\noindent I am extremely lucky to have received much support from my family, friends, and mentors.  Without these people this dissertation would never have been possible.  I am indebted to my dissertation advisor Carl Caves, from whom you can find friendship, knowledge, wisdom, and encouragement.  Carl is one of those physicists who think not only about research, but also pay a lot of attention to advancing their students.  I am owing to Xiao-Nan Wang and Jiong-Ming Zhu, who first showed me how to think like a physicist; Qing Chen, who introduced me to the field of quantum information; Ivan Deutsch, who taught me useful things such as quantum optics and warmly encouraged my progress; Andrew Landahl, for his excellent advice on how to make a good talk; Akimasa Miyake, who cares for me as if I were his own student; and Marco Piani at the Institute for Quantum Computing, with whom I had a very pleasant and fruitful collaboration.

Many thanks to Alex Tacla, from whom I learned how to balance life and research; Shashank Pandey, who made the most serious thinking of our quantum amplifier papers; Matthias Lang, who kept me from a couple of computer disasters; Josh Combes, who was very generous to give me advice on academia and to teach me how to climb like an expert; Vaibhav Madhok, who made life in CQuIC full of surprises; Jonas Anderson, who pointed out a lot of interesting things to me; Chris Cesare, from whom I learned what topological quantum computing is; Ben Baragiola, who decorated our office like a botanic garden; Robert Cook, a playful but serious physicist; Leigh Norris, who saved my life by teaching me how not to make ugly Mathematica plots; Carlos Riofr\'{i}o, whose warmth and care made CQuIC a better place; Krittika Goya, who taught me what a Feshbach resonance is; Robin Blume-Kohout, who helped me to revise my presentation slides; and the rest of current or former CQuIC group guys---Charlie Baldwin, Sergio Boixo, Adrian Chapman, Ninnat Dangniam, Bryan Eastin, Andrew Ferdinand, Chris Ferrie, Steve Flammia, Jonathan Gross, Bob Keating, Jacob Miller, Seth Merkel, Xiaodong Qi, Akash Rakholia, Iris Reichenbach, Anil Shaji, Ezad Shojaee, Munik Shrestha, and Rolando Somma.

I also thank Vicky Bird for booking the flights and hotels and for filling my empty stomach; Alisa Gibson for all the paperwork, even before I came to UNM, that she did so smoothly; and Linda Melville for much helpful advice about living and studying in the US.
