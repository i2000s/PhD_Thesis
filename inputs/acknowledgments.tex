\noindent This dissertation would have never been possible without all the supports from my family, friends, and mentors. I only highlight a few below. 
I am indebted to my dissertation advisor Ivan Deutsch, from whom you can find friendship, knowledge, wisdom, and encouragement.  Ivan is one of those physicists who think not only about research, but also pay a lot of attentions to advancing their students via inspiring teaching, thoughtful spiritual supports and uninterrupted funding supports. The freedom and trust he granted to me is the highest privilege and invaluable treasure for me to contemplate about the big picture of the field and ask the important questions over years, without worrying about writing small and fast papers, to help the scientific community and our collaborators conquer the biggest theoretical barriers ahead. The opportunities I have gained in the course of study--including but not limited to the opportunities of questioning, trying and failing, pinpointing down concrete ideas, coordinating with our collaborators and solving the theoretical problems with a proof-of-principle demonstration--are the best touchstone for me to grow my confidence of conducting independent and collaborative researches for my future adventure. Moreover, thinking and discussing subjects fully in the physics language beside math that I have been learning from Ivan close my fear of thinking far into the unknown future. 

I am owing to Prof. Baoxun Du, who I may not have a chance to see again yet significantly infected me with his dedication of creating new knowledge and passing the knowledge to my generation as a physicist; my parents, Mr. Yuanjie Qi and Mrs. Tinghui Fu, for their understanding and encouragement for me to finish my degree study oversea; Prof. Carl Caves and Prof. Akimasa Miyake, who introduced me to the broad field of quantum information and quantum computing; Prof. Poul Jessen, for his excellent insight on my research subject from the experimental side; Prof. Sudahka Prasad and Prof. Alejandro Manjavacas, who support me as if I were their own student; Prof. Yuan-Yu Jau and Dr. Jongmin Lee at the Sandia National Labs and Perry Rice at the Miami University, with whom I had very pleasant and fruitful collaborations; Prof. Arash Mafi, who provided me helpful feedbacks and advices for my study; as well as Prof. Elohim Becerra, with whom I always feel comfortable to knock the door and ask possibilities of experimental implementations of my naive theoretical ideas and extended collaborations with his experimental colleagues elsewhere. I am also grateful to Dr. Pablo Solano, now, at MIT, and Prof. Lius Orozco at the University of Maryland for their stimulating discussions on the mechanical oscillations of atoms due to the launch of a probe they observed in the lab, which eventually inspired me to think about the direction on minimizing the disruption of the probe light to the atoms for my dissertation work. 

Many thanks to Ben Baragiola, from whom I learned the essential of quantum measurement and how to conquer a big research subject by dividing it into solvable pieces; Josh Combes, who was my role model as an excellent researcher across the hallway and always in the office during weekends; Ninnat (Tom) Dangniam and Matt Chase, who are my most reliable lunch/dinner mates and shared their time and opinions with me on every corner of life; Ezad Shojaee, who made the most serious thinking of our countless questions to him; Johnson Gross and Anupam Mitra, who shared the common interests in programming and beyond; Raf Alexander, who was very generous to give me advice on academia and writing; Qufei Gu, Zhixian Yu, Lewis Chiang, Nan Li, Xijie Luo, Lei Ma and Ning Hsu, who made life in the US home with frequent ride offering, gathering times and cheers; Adrian Chapman, James Hendrie, Akram Etemadi Amin, Karishma Bansal, Anirban Chowdhury, Sayonee Ray, Maria (Mariami) Gachechiladze and Davide Orsucci, who made my life in Albuquerque full of surprises and fun with game nights, parties and seasonal events; Leigh Norris, from whom I learned all the details about spin squeezing that I couldn't find elsewhere and received very kind care and the joy of interacting with her dog; Bob Keating, Charlie Baldwin, Robert Cook, Amir Kalev, Gopi Muraleedharan, and Karthik Chinni, who supported me as a group member in all aspects; Travis Shelton, whose standard on colormaps and presentations is a luxury for me to reach but a significant topic to learn; Zhang Jiang, who taught me driving and advised me as a big brother; Jacob Miller, who occasionally speak Chinese with me and warmly reminded me not to stay too late in the office; Robin Blume-Kohout, who inspired me with better presentation styles; Andy Ferdinand, Satomi Sugaya and Mohamad Fazel, who made my last sweet home in Albuquerque and filled my hungry stomach with perfect food; and the rest of current or former CQuIC people---Chris Jackson, Chris Cesare, Chris Ferrie, Matthias Lang, Pablo Poggi, Ciaran Ryan-Anderson, Shashank Pandey, Akash Rakholia, Nathaniel Ristoff, Matthew DiMario, Matthew Curry, and Rolando Somma.

I also thank Gloria Cordova and Vicky Bird for booking flights and hotels and for helping me on countless tiny yet important office things; Alisa Gibson for all the paperwork and administration reminders that I couldn't imagine how she managed everything timely; Tom Hess and Leanne Yanabu, who saved my life on computer and website stuff; Gary Harrison and Steve Portillo, who always fixed small but annoying problems in the office promptly, like the dark light, leaking pips and broken lockers, to create a comfortable working environment for me; and Linda Melville for much helpful advice about living and studying in the \hbox{US} as the international student advisor.

In writing this dissertation, I have received careful and prompt proofreads and edits from Ivan, Ninnat (Tom), Johar Ashfaque (at Max-Planck-Institute) and Joshua Teves (on Reddit).
Without their help, this dissertation could not be finished in time. I would like to thank them from heart.

I may not have much to return to everyone individually, but persisting my passion and endeavor that, I believe, will better our shared future life, as I did before, is the journey I will continue on.
