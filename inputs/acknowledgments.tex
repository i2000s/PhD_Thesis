\noindent This dissertation would have never been possible without all the supports from my family, friends, and mentors. I only highlight a few below. 
I am indebted to my dissertation advisor Ivan Deutsch, from whom you can find friendship, knowledge, wisdom, and encouragement.  Ivan is one of those physicists who think not only about research, but also pay a lot of attention to advancing their students via inspiring teaching, thoughtful spiritual concern and uninterrupted funding support. I don't know if my physics intuition satisfy his standard, but thinking and discussing subjects fully in physics language beyond math is one of the most important lessons I am learning from Ivan. 
I am owing to Baoxun Du, who I may not have a chance to see again yet significantly infected me with his dedication of creating new knowledge and passing the knowledge to my generation as a physicist; my parents, Yuanjie Qi and Tinghui Fu, for their understanding and encouragement for me to finish my degree study oversea; Carl Caves and Akimasa Miyake, who introduced me to the broad field of quantum information and quantum computing; Poul Jessen, for his excellent insight on my research subject from the experimental side; Sudahka Prasad, who supports me as if I were his own student; Yuan-Yu Jau and Jongmin Lee at the Sandia National Labs and Perry Rice at the Miami University, with whom I had very pleasant and fruitful collaborations; Arash Mafi, who provided me helpful feedbacks and advices for my study; as well as Elohim Becerra, with whom I always feel comfortable to knock the door and ask possibilities of experimental implementations of my naive theoretical ideas and extended collaborations with his experimental colleagues elsewhere.

Many thanks to Ben Baragiola, from whom I learned the essential of quantum measurement and how to conquer a big research subject by dividing it into solvable pieces; Josh Combes, who was my role model as an excellent researcher across the hallway and always in the office during weekends; Tom (Ninnat) Dangniam and Matt Chase, who are my most reliable lunch/dinner mates and shared their time and opinions with me on every corner of life; Ezad Shojaee, who made the most serious thinking of our countless questions to him; Johnson Gross and Anupam Mitra, who shared the common interests in programming and beyond; Raf Alexander, who was very generous to give me advice on academia and writing; Qufei Gu, Zhixian Yu, Lewis Chiang, Xijie Luo, Lei Ma and Ning Xu, who made life in the US home with frequent ride offering, gathering times and cheers; Adrian Chapman, James Hendrie, Akram Etemadi Amin, Karishma Bansal, Anirban Chowdhury, Sayonee Ray, Maria (Mariami) Gachechiladze and Davide Orsucci, who made my life in Albuquerque full of surprises and fun with game nights, parties and seasonal events; Leigh Norris, from whom I learned all the details about spin squeezing that I couldn't find elsewhere and received very kind care and the joy of interacting with her dog; Bob Keating, Charlie Baldwin, Robert Cook, Amir Kalev, Gopi Muraleedharan, and Karthik Chinni, who supported me as a group member in all aspects; Travis Shelton, whose standard on colormaps and presentations is a luxury for me to reach; Zhang Jiang, who taught me driving and advised me as a big brother; Jacob Miller, who occasionally speak Chinese with me and warmly reminded me not to stay too late in the office; Robin Blume-Kohout, who inspired me with better presentation styles; Andy Ferdinand, Satomi Sugaya and Mohamad Fazel, who made my last sweet home in Albuquerque and filled my hungry stomach with perfect food; and the rest of current or former CQuIC people---Chris Jackson, Chris Cesare, Chris Ferrie, Matthias Lang, Pablo Poggi, Ciaran Ryan-Anderson, Shashank Pandey, Akash Rakholia, Nathaniel Ristoff, Matthew DiMario, Matthew Curry, and Rolando Somma.

I also thank Gloria Cordova and Vicky Bird for booking the flights and hotels and for helped me avoid life disasters by picking out critical mistakes in the forms I filled out in a rush; Alisa Gibson for all the paperwork and administration reminders that I couldn't imagine how she managed everything timely; Tom Hess and Leanne Yanabu, who saved my life on computer and website stuff; Gary Harrison and Steve Portillo, who always fixed small but annoying problems in the office promptly, like the dark light, leaking pips and broken lockers, to create a comfortable working environment for me; and Linda Melville for much helpful advice about living and studying in the \hbox{US} as the international student advisor.

I don't have much to return for everyone's contributions, but persisting my passion and endeavor as before is my promise.
