The impact of interparticle correlations on the behavior of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) is discussed using two approaches. In the first approach, the wavefunction of a BEC is encoded in the <var>N</var>-particle sector of an extended ``catalytic state''. Going to a time-dependent interaction picture, we can organize the effective Hamiltonian by powers of <var>N</var><sup>&nbsp;-1/2</sup>.  Requiring the terms of order <var>N</var><sup>1/2</sup> to vanish, we get the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation. Going to the next order, <var>N</var><sup>0</sup>, we obtain the number-conserving Bogoliubov approximation. Our approach allows one to stay in the Schr&ouml;dinger picture and to apply many techniques from quantum optics. Moreover, it is easier to track different orders in the Hamiltonian and to generalize to the multi-component case. In the second approach, I consider a state of <var>N</var>=<var>l</var>&times;<var>n</var> bosons that is derived by symmetrizing the <var>n</var>-fold tensor product of an arbitrary <var>l</var>-boson state. Particularly, we are interested in the pure state case for <var>l</var>=2, which we call the Pair-Correlated State (PCS). I show that PCS reproduces the number-conserving Bogoliubov approximation; moreover, it also works in the strong interaction regime where the Bogoliubov approximation fails. For the two-site Bose-Hubbard model, I find numerically that the error (measured by trace distance of the two-particle RDMs) of PCS is less than two percent over the entire parameter space, thus making PCS a bridge between the superfluid and Mott insulating phases. Amazingly, the error of PCS does not increase, in the time-dependent case, as the system evolves for longer times. I derive both time-dependent and -independent equations for the ground state and the time evolution of the PCS ansatz. The time complexity of simulating PCS does not depend on <var>N</var> and is linear in the number of orbitals in use. Compared to other methods, e.g, the Jastrow wavefunction, the Gutzwiller wavefunction, and the multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree method, our approach does not require quantum Monte Carlo nor demanding computational power.
