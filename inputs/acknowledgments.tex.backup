I am extremely lucky to have received many supports from my family, friends, and mentors. Without these people this dissertation would never have been possible. I am indebted to my dissertation advisor Carl Caves---from whom you can find friendship, knowledge, wisdom, and encouragement. Carl is one of the physicists who not only think about researches but also pay a lot of attentions to advance their students. I am owing to XiaoNan Wang and JiongMing Zhu, who first showed me how to think like a physicist; Qing Chen, who introduced me to the field of quantum information science; Ivan Deutsch, who taught me useful things including quantum optics and warmly encouraged my progresses; Andrew Landahl, for his advices on how to make great talks; Akimasa Miyake, who cares me as if I were his own student; Marco Piani at IQC, with whom I had a very pleasant and fruitful collaboration. 

Many thanks to Alex Tacla, from whom I learned how to balance life and research; Shashank Pandey, who made the most serious thinking of our quantum amplifier papers; Matthias Lang, who kept me from a couple of computer disasters; Josh Combes, who was very generous to give me advice on academia and to teach me how to climb like an expert; Vaibhav Madhok, who made life in CQuIC full of surprises; Jonas Anderson, who pointed out a lot of interesting stuffs to me; Chris Cesare, from whom I learned what is topological quantum computing; Ben Baragiola, who decorated our office like a botanic garden; Robert Cook, a playful but serious physicist; Leigh Norris, who saved my life from making ugly Mathematica plots; Carlos Riofr\'{i}o, whose warmth and care made CQuIC a better place; Krittika Goya, who taught me what is Feshbach resonance; Robin Blume-Kohout, who helped me to revise my presentation slides; and the rest of current or former CQuIC group guys---Charlie Baldwin, Sergio Boixo, Adrian Chapman, Ninnat Dangniam, Bryan Eastin, 
Andrew Ferdinand, Chris Ferrie, Steve Flammia, Jonathan Gross, Bob Keating, Jacob Miller, Seth Merkel, Xiaodong Qi, Akash Rakholia, Iris Reichenbach, Anil Shaji, Ezad Shojaee, Munik Shrestha, and Rolando Somma. 
  
I also thank Vicky Bird for booking the flights and hotels and for filling our empty stomachs; Alisa Gibson for all the paper works, even before I came to UNM, you have done so smoothly; Linda Melville for many helpful advice about living in the US.
