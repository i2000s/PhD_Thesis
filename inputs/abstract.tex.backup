The impact of interparticle correlations on the behavior of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) is discussed using two approaches.  In the first approach, the wavefunction of a BEC is encoded in the $N$-particle sector of an extended ``catalytic state''.  Going to a time-dependent interaction picture, we can organize the effective Hamiltonian by powers of ${N}^{-\half}$.   Requiring the terms of order ${N}^{\half}$ to vanish, we get the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation (GPE).  Going to the next order, $N^0$, we obtain the number-conserving Bogoliubov approximation.  Our approach allows one to stay in the Schr\"{o}dinger picture and to apply many techniques from quantum optics.  Moreover, it is much easier to track different orders in the Hamiltonian and to generalize to the multi-component case.  In the second approach, I consider a state of $N =l\times n$ bosons that is derived by symmetrizing the $n$-fold tensor product of an arbitrary $l$-boson state.  The rationale behind this is the BBGKY hierarchy: Errors to the many-particle Reduced Density Matrices (RDMs) only weakly affect the few-particle RDMs.  Particularly, we are interested in the pure state case for $l=2$, which we call the Pair-Correlated State (PCS).  I show that PCS reproduces the number-conserving Bogoliubov approximation; moreover, it also works in the strong interaction regime where the Bogoliubov approximation fails.   For the two-site Bose-Hubbard model, I find numerically that the error (measured by trace distance of the two-particle RDMs) of PCS is less than two percent over the entire parameter space, thus making PCS a bridge between the superfluid and Mott insulating phases.  Amazingly, the error of PCS does not increase, in the time-dependent case, as the system evolves for longer times.  I derive both time-dependent and -independent equations for the ground state and the time evolution of the PCS ansatz, along with a condition for fragmentation of BECs.  The time complexity of simulating PCS does not depend on $N$ and is linear in the number of orbitals in use.  Compared to other methods, e.g, the Jastrow wavefunction, the Gutzwiller wavefunction, and the multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree method, our approach does not require quantum Monte Carlo nor very demanding computational power.
