  abstract  = {The tight focus of Gaussian beams is commonly used to trap dielectric particles in optical tweezers. The corresponding field distribution generates a well-defined trapping potential that is only marginally controllable on a nanometre scale. Here we investigate the influence of a metal nanostructure that is located in the vicinity of the trapping focus on the trapping potential by calculating the corresponding field and force distributions. Even for an excitation wavelength that is tuned far from the plasmonic resonance of the nanostructure, the presence of the latter alters significantly the trap potential. For the given nanostructure, a ring of spheres that is illuminated in the axial direction, a smaller focus volume is observed in comparison to free focus. The superposition of this non-resonant Gaussian field with a planar wave illumination that is tuned to the plasmonic resonance gives a handle to modify the trapping potential. Polarization and intensity of the resonant illumination allows modifying the equilibrium position of the trapping potential, thus providing means to steer dielectric particles with nanometre precision.},

By preparing an initial spin coherent state, for any measurement performed after the evolution, the mean-square error of the estimate is known to scale as IMG [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/19/12/123011/njpaa9840ieqn1.gif] {$1/J$} , i.e. no quantum enhancement is obtained. Here, we consider the possibility of continuously monitoring the atomic environment, and conclusively show that strategies based on time-continuous non-demolition measurements followed by a final strong measurement may achieve Heisenberg-limited scaling IMG [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/19/12/123011/njpaa9840ieqn2.gif] {$1/{J}^{2}$} and also a monitoring-enhanced scaling in terms of the interrogation time. We also find that time-continuous schemes are robust against detection losses, as we prove that the quantum enhancement can be recovered also for finite measurement efficiency. Finally, we analytically prove the optimality of our strategy.},

  abstract  = {Over the years extensive studies have been carried out to apply coherent optics methods in real-time communications and image transmission. This is especially true when a large amount of information needs to be processed, e.g., in high-resolution imaging. The recent progress in data-processing networks and communication systems has considerably increased the capacity of information exchange. However, the transmitted data can be intercepted by nonauthorized people. This explains why considerable effort is being devoted at the current time to data encryption and secure transmission. In addition, only a small part of the overall information is really useful for many applications. Consequently, applications can tolerate information compression that requires important processing when the transmission bit rate is taken into account. To enable efficient and secure information exchange, it is often necessary to reduce the amount of transmitted information. In this context, much work has been undertaken using the principle of coherent optics filtering for selecting relevant information and encrypting it. Compression and encryption operations are often carried out separately, although they are strongly related and can influence each other. Optical processing methodologies, based on filtering, are described that are applicable to transmission and/or data storage. Finally, the advantages and limitations of a set of optical compression and encryption methods are discussed.},

The analysis is carried out for an arbitrary grid of circular air holes of the fiber guide, while the electromagnetic field is taken to be a vector quantity. Application of the Green's-function concept leads to a coupled system of equations incorporating as unknowns the field expansion coefficients to cylindrical wave functions within the air holes. The propagation constants of the guided waves are computed accurately by determining the singular points of the corresponding system's matrix. Field distribution and dispersion properties of guided modes as well as coupling phenomena between parallel-running holey fibers are investigated, and numerical results are presented.},

Under the tight-binding approximation, such a system realizes an array of weakly coupled trapped two-component atomic ensembles interacting with the optical field in a tunnel-coupled one-dimensional cavity array. We have shown that the phase transition to the superfluid Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer state, a so-called (BCS)-type state of low branch polaritons, occurs under the strong coupling condition. Such a transition results in the appearance of a macroscopic polarization of the atomic medium at non-zero frequency. The principal result is that the group velocity of polaritons depends essentially on the order parameter of the system, i.e. on the average photon number in the cavity array.},

  abstract  = {This tutorial gives an overview of the use of the Wigner function as a tool for modeling optical field propagation. Particular emphasis is placed on the spatial propagation of stationary fields, as well as on the propagation of pulses through dispersive media. In the first case, the Wigner function gives a representation of the field that is similar to a radiance or weight distribution for all the rays in the system, since its arguments are both position and direction. In cases in which the field is paraxial and where the system is described by a simple linear relation in the ray regime, the Wigner function is constant under propagation along rays. An equivalent property holds for optical pulse propagation in dispersive media under analogous assumptions. Several properties and applications of the Wigner function in these contexts are discussed, as is its connection with other common phase-space distributions like the ambiguity function, the spectrogram, and the Husimi, P, Q, and Kirkwood\&\#8211;Rihaczek functions. Also discussed are modifications to the definition of the Wigner function that allow extending the property of conservation along paths to a wider range of problems, including nonparaxial field propagation and pulse propagation within general transparent dispersive media.},

A closed system of equations involving these spreads is obtained by expanding the potential in powers about the mean position and by neglecting terms of third order or higher in the deviations from the mean, an approximation appropriate when the force does not vary too much over the width of the packet. These equations are solved in terms of the trajectories of a classical time-dependent oscillator. These trajectories can be found by differentiation of the trajectories for the force under consideration. In more than one dimension, or for more than one particle, the appropriate generalisation of the spread is the set of second-order correlations.},

  abstract  = {One of the greatest challenges in the fields of quantum information processing and quantum technologies is the detailed coherent control over each and every constituent of quantum systems with an ever increasing number of particles. Within this endeavor, harnessing of many-body entanglement against the detrimental effects of the environment is a major pressing issue. Besides being an important concept from a fundamental standpoint, entanglement has been recognized as a crucial resource for quantum speed-ups or performance enhancements over classical methods. Understanding and controlling many-body entanglement in open systems may have strong implications in quantum computing, quantum simulations of many-body systems, secure quantum communication or cryptography, quantum metrology, our understanding of the quantum-to-classical transition, and other important questions of quantum foundations. In this paper we present an overview of recent theoretical and experimental efforts to underpin the dynamics of entanglement under the influence of noise. Entanglement is thus taken as a dynamic quantity on its own, and we survey how it evolves due to the unavoidable interaction of the entangled system with its surroundings. We analyze several scenarios, corresponding to different families of states and environments, which render a very rich diversity of dynamical behaviors. In contrast to single-particle quantities, like populations and coherences, which typically vanish only asymptotically in time, entanglement may disappear at a finite time. In addition, important classes of entanglement display an exponential decay with the number of particles when subject to local noise, which poses yet another threat to the already-challenging scaling of quantum technologies. Other classes, however, turn out to be extremely robust against local noise. Theoretical results and recent experiments regarding the difference between local and global decoherence are summarized. Control and robustness-enhancement techniques, scaling laws, statistical and geometrical aspects of multipartite-entanglement decay are also reviewed; all in order to give a broad picture of entanglement dynamics in open quantum systems addressed to both theorists and experimentalists inside and outside the field of quantum information.},

In particular, squeezing the fluctuations via entanglement between 2-level atoms can improve the precision of sensing, clocks, metrology, and spectroscopy. Here, we demonstrate 3.4 dB of metrologically relevant squeezing and entanglement for 105 cold caesium atoms via a quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement on the atom clock levels. We show that there is an optimal degree of decoherence induced by the quantum measurement which maximizes the generated entanglement. A 2-color QND scheme used in this paper is shown to have a number of advantages for entanglement generation as compared with a single-color QND measurement.},

  abstract  = {This paper addresses the relation between fabrication imperfections and the performance of a photonic crystal coupled resonator optical waveguide (CROW). A semi-analytical model is presented, which calculates the perturbation of the coupling coefficients through their derivatives with respect to geometric characteristics of the rods of the photonic crystal lattice. Once these derivatives are calculated, it becomes possible to estimate the transfer functions of a large number of randomly perturbed devices at a small additional computational cost. This enables the statistical study of many performance issues of CROWs, such as the amplitude and position of the device's resonances. The model can be used to study the influence of imperfections of different strengths and types on CROWs of various lengths.},

  abstract  = {Emission spectra of quantum dot arrays in zero-dimensional microcavities are studied theoretically. It is shown that their form is determined by the competition between collective superradiant mode formation and inhomogeneous broadening. A random sources method is used to calculate the photoluminescence spectra from an nonresonant pumped microcavity, and a standard diagram technique is used to provide a microscopic justification for the random sources method. The emission spectra of a microcavity are analyzed taking into account the spread of exciton energy due to inhomogeneous distribution of quantum dots and tunneling between them. It is demonstrated that the luminescence spectra of strongly tunnel-coupled quantum dots are sensitive to the dot positions, and the collective mode can (under certain conditions) be stabilized by random tunneling links.

This construction allows us to determine the power spectrum of the noise from measurements of dephasing rates. Moreover, by studying the derived equation it is possible to optimize the control as well as to test numerical algorithms that solve controlled stochastic Schrödinger equations. A few examples are worked out in detail.},

  abstract      = {In this dissertation, I explore interactions between matter and propagating light. The electromagnetic field is modeled as a reservoir of quantum harmonic oscillators successively streaming past a quantum system. Each weak and fleeting interaction entangles the light and the system, and the light continues its course. Within the framework of open quantum systems, the light is eventually traced out, leaving the reduced quantum state of the system as the primary mathematical subject. Two major results are presented. The first is a master equation approach for a quantum system interacting with a traveling wave packet prepared with a definite number of photons. In contrast to quasi-classical states, such as coherent or thermal fields, these N-photon states possess temporal mode entanglement, and local interactions in time have nonlocal consequences. The second is a model for a three-dimensional light-matter interface for an atomic ensemble interacting with a paraxial laser beam and its application to the generation of QND spin squeezing. Both coherent and incoherent dynamics due to spatially inhomogeneous atom-light coupling across the ensemble are accounted for. Measurement of paraxially scattered light can generate squeezing of an atomic spin wave, while diffusely scattered photons lead to spatially local decoherence.},

  abstract  = {A semiclassical model consisting of two noninteracting waveguide arrays along with three side-coupled waveguides is presented to demonstrate the optical analogue of double Fano resonance. The photonic system is configured so that it causes simultaneous cross coupling between two decay channels via one array and another two decay channels via the other array. Owing to the two individual interference effects, the decay-rate profile for the waveguide coupled directly to the continuum exhibits two asymmetric peaks, or dips, or a combination of one peak and one dip in the vicinity of the frequency mismatches. As far as the distribution of optical field amplitudes in the side-coupled waveguides is concerned, the present model also demonstrates the features of optical trapping (optical analogue of coherent population trapping) in side-coupled waveguides under certain symmetric parametric conditions.},

A mesoscopic ensemble containing a few thousand atoms is trapped in the evanescent field of a nanofiber. The atom number is measured through dual-color homodyne interferometry with a pW-power shot noise limited probe. Strong coupling of the evanescent probe guided by the nanofiber allows for a real-time measurement with a precision of 8 atoms on an ensemble of some 103 atoms in a one-dimensional trap. The method is very well suited for generating collective atomic entangled or spin-squeezed states via a quantum nondemolition measurement as well as for tomography of exotic atomic states in a one-dimensional lattice.},

The single fiber provides a good calibration source for polarization nephalometers, being free from problems inherent with spheres in solution. The fiber is a well-known geometry which is amenable to perturbation toward irregular shapes, and as such it provides the starting point for studying scattering from irregular particles.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Consider a bipartite quantum system with at least one of its two components being itself a composite system. By tracing over part of one (or both) of these two subsystems it is possible to obtain a reduced (separable) state that exhibits quantum correlations even if the original state of the full system is endowed only with classical correlations. This effect, first pointed out by Li and Luo in (2008), is of considerable interest because there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that quantum correlations in non-entangled, mixed states may constitute a useful resource to implement non trivial information related tasks. Here we conduct a systematic exploration of the aforementioned effect for particular families of states of quantum systems of low dimensionality (three qubits states). In order to assess the non-classicality of the correlations of the reduced states we use an indicator of quantum correlations based upon the state disturbances generated by the measurement of local observables. We show, for a three-qubit system, that there exists a relationship between the classical mutual information of the original classically correlated states and the maximum quantum correlation exhibited by the reduced states.},

Here, we discuss this method in greater detail, comparing it to the widely employed Raman sideband coupling method. We provide a simplified model for sideband cooling in a spin-dependent potential, and we discuss it in terms of the generalized Lamb–Dicke parameter. Using a master equation formalism, we present a quantitative analysis of the cooling performance for our experiment, which can be generalized to other experimental settings. We additionally use microwave sideband transitions to engineer motional Fock states and coherent states, and we devise a technique for measuring the population distribution of the prepared states.},

  abstract  = {The so-called PT symmetric devices, which feature $\epsilon$({\textminus}x)$=\epsilon$(x)  $\ast$ associated with parity-time symmetry, incorporate both gain and loss and can present a singular eigenvalue behaviour around a critical transition point. The scheme, typically based on co-directional coupled waveguides, is here transposed to the case of variable gain on one arm with fixed losses on the other arm. In this configuration, the scheme exploits the full potential of plasmonics by making a beneficial use of their losses to attain a critical regime that makes switching possible with much lowered gain excursions. Practical implementations are discussed based on existing attempts to elaborate coupled waveguide in plasmonics, and based also on the recently proposed hybrid plasmonics waveguide structure with a small low-index gap, the PIROW (Plasmonic Inverse-Rib Optical Waveguide).},

Similar to radiowave and microwave antennas, their purpose is to convert the energy of free propagating radiation to localized energy, and vice versa. Optical antennas exploit the unique properties of metal nanostructures, which behave as strongly coupled plasmas at optical frequencies. The tutorial provides an account of the historical origins and the basic concepts and parameters associated with optical antennas. It also reviews recent work in the field and discusses areas of application, such as light-emitting devices, photovoltaics, and spectroscopy.},

They can provide an efficient approximation to certain classes of quantum states, and the associated graphical language makes it easy to describe and pictorially reason about quantum circuits, channels, protocols, open systems and more. Our goal is to explain tensor networks and some associated methods as quickly and as painlessly as possible. Beginning with the key definitions, the graphical tensor network language is presented through examples. We then provide an introduction to matrix product states. We conclude the tutorial with tensor contractions evaluating combinatorial counting problems. The first one counts the number of solutions for Boolean formulae, whereas the second is Penrose's tensor contraction algorithm, returning the number of \$3\$-edge-colorings of \$3\$-regular planar graphs.},

  abstract  = {Microcavities can be used to control the spectral properties of ensembles of quantum dots. In this work, spherical microcavities with quality (Q) factors as high as 3 x 108 in air were coated with a layer of fluorescent silicon quantum dots. After coating, the transmission Q factors decreased to approximately 106 or slightly lower, while the luminescence Q-factors (QPL) reached a maximum of ~4000. While these are the highest QPL values yet reported for Si QDs, QPL was always orders of magnitude lower than the intrinsic cavity Q. One reason for the difference has its origin in the quantum dot emission linewidth, which is associated only with the QPL and not with the cold cavity (intrinsic) Q. Essentially, the Q factor in luminescence experiments arises from the spontaneous emission rate enhancements or suppressions experienced by the dot in the cavity. We developed a general model to calculate the luminescence spectrum and decay dynamics for an inhomogeneously broadened ensemble of quantum dots with arbitrary emission linewidths weakly coupled to an optical cavity. Using this model and comparing it with experiment, we show that the respective values of the luminescence quality factors and the cold cavity quality factors can be used to determine an effective quantum dot emission linewidth without the need for single particle spectroscopy. In the case of Si quantum dots, the room temperature emission linewidth may be as small as a few meV at room temperature.},

This approach avoids the introduction of a box-related mode spacing and enables us to use a continuum frequency space description. We introduce a complete orthonormal set of operators that can describe states of finite energy. The set is countable and the operators have all the usual properties of the single-mode frequency operators. With use of these operators a generalization of the single-mode normal-ordering theorem is proved. We discuss the inclusion of material dispersion and pulse propagation in an optical fiber. Finally, we consider the process of photodetection in free space, concluding with a discussion of homodyne detection with both local oscillator and signal fields pulsed.},

  abstract  = {Fundamental quantum noise limits the precision of quantum-based detectors, for example limiting the ultimate precision of atomic clocks, which have applications in communication, navigation and tests of fundamental physics. Collective measurements of many quantum spins can project the ensemble into an entangled, spin-squeezed state with improved quantum-limited measurement resolution. However, measurement back-action has limited previous implementations of collective measurements to only modest observed enhancements in precision. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a collective measurement with reduced measurement back-action to produce and directly observe, with no background subtraction, a spin-squeezed state with phase resolution improved by a factor of 10.5(1.5) in variance, or 10.2(6) dB, compared to the initially unentangled ensemble of N = 4.8x 10^5 87Rb atoms. The measurement uses a cavity-enhanced probe of an optical cycling transition, mitigating back-action associated with state-changing transitions induced by the probe. This work establishes collective measurements as a powerful technique for generating useful entanglement for precision measurements.},

Pre- and post-fabrication tuning capability of the designed structures is explored, and a novel concept of realization of tunable CROW-based routers and switches is introduced. The proposed tuning mechanism exploits the properties of CROW optical modes coupling with avoided crossing scenario rather than the previously used Vernier effect. Applications of spectrally-engineered branched CROW structures for controllable manipulation of coupling between spatially separated nano-emitters are also discussed.},

Having almost exhausted available degrees of freedom to orthogonally multiplex data, the possibility is now being explored of using spatial modes of fibers to enhance data capacity. We demonstrate the viability of using the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light to create orthogonal, spatially distinct streams of data-transmitting channels that are multiplexed in a single fiber. Over 1.1 kilometers of a specially designed optical fiber that minimizes mode coupling, we achieved 400-gigabits-per-second data transmission using four angular momentum modes at a single wavelength, and 1.6 terabits per second using two OAM modes over 10 wavelengths. These demonstrations suggest that OAM could provide an additional degree of freedom for data multiplexing in future fiber networks.},

  abstract  = {The microscopic and the macroscopic (phenomenological) approach to the electromagnetic theory in matter can be looked upon as complementary to each other. In view of the complexity of the deductive microscopic approach it is desirable to use experimental information to test the predictions of the more simple macroscopic theory. The purpose of the present paper is to review and give the theory of experiments and Gedanken experiments in relation to various expressions for the electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor. The paper is divided into three parts. The first part discusses the electrostriction effect, mainly in electrostatic experiments. It turns out that both the Hakim-Higham experiment (1962) and the Goetz-Zahn experiment (1958) agree with the predictions of the Helmholtz theory and disagree with the predictions of the Einstein-Laub theory. The second part of the paper is concerned with quasi-stationary crossed electric and magnetic fields. The electrostriction effect is here unimportant. Both the experiment of Walker et al. (1975) and that of James (1968) support the Abraham tensor in contradiction to the Minkowski tensor. The third and most extensive part of the paper discusses optical phenomena, in which case a direct observation of the fluctuating Abraham force cannot be made. Under usual circumstances, it turns out to be simplest to use the divergence-free Minkowski tensor. This tensor describes satisfactorily all existing force or torque experiments in optics that we are aware of. Some attention is given also to the tensor alternative recently introduced by Peierls (1976).},

In a second-order perturbation it is shown that a non-Markovian evolution for the stochastic state vector leads to a dissipative generator which has a Kossakowski-Lindblad form. In this context it is possible to analyse the completely positive condition. The equivalence of this picture with the trace-out technique in the weak coupling approximation has been proved.},

  abstract   = {Within the frame of macroscopic QED in linear, causal media, we study the radiation force of Casimir-Polder type acting on an atom which is positioned near dispersing and absorbing magnetodielectric bodies and initially prepared in an arbitrary electronic state. It is shown that minimal and multipolar coupling lead to essentially the same lowest-order perturbative result for the force acting on an atom in an energy eigenstate. To go beyond perturbation theory, the calculations are based on the exact center-of-mass equation of motion. For a nondriven atom in the weak-coupling regime, the force as a function of time is a superposition of force components that are related to the electronic density matrix elements at a chosen time. Even the force component associated with the ground state is not derivable from a potential in the ususal way, because of the position dependence of the atomic polarizability. Further, when the atom is initially prepared in a coherent superposition of energy eigenstates, then temporally oscillating force components are observed, which are due to the interaction of the atom with both electric and magnetic fields.},

The normalization and the Hermitian property of the reduced density matrix are guaranteed. To the lowest order of the Kubo number, a temperature-dependent Kossakowski-Lindblad map is found. A particular system is solved: the harmonic oscillator in interaction with a thermal bath of oscillators. The classical limit is also discussed.

Four different geometries are evaluated theoretically, before experimentally investigating coupling in a direction at 30 to the line of the cavities. In this geometry, a smooth variation of the energy splitting with the cavity separation is predicted and observed, together with significant differences between the polarizations of the bonding and anti-bonding states. The controlled splitting of the coupled states is potentially useful for applications that require simultaneous resonant enhancement of two transitions.},

  abstract  = {We analyze fast- and slow-light transmission in a zigzag microring resonator chain. In the superluminal case, a new light-transmission effect is found whereby the input optical pulse is reproduced in an almost-simultaneous manner at the various system outputs. When the input carrier is tuned to a different frequency, the system permits to slow down the propagating optical signal. Between these two extreme cases, the relative delay can be tuned within a broad range. We propose, and analyze numerically, a laser-array configuration for the stable operation of active devices.},

  abstract  = {An elementary quantum network operation involves storing a qubit state in an atomic quantum memory node, and then retrieving and transporting the information through a single photon excitation to a remote quantum memory node for further storage or analysis. Implementations of quantum network operations are thus conditioned on the ability to realize matter-to-light and/or light-to-matter quantum state mappings. Here we report the generation, transmission, storage and retrieval of single quanta using two remote atomic ensembles. A single photon is generated from a cold atomic ensemble at one site , and is directed to another site through 100 metres of optical fibre. The photon is then converted into a single collective atomic excitation using a dark-state polariton approach. After a programmable storage time, the atomic excitation is converted back into a single photon. This is demonstrated experimentally, for a storage time of 0.5 microseconds, by measurement of an anti-correlation parameter. Storage times exceeding ten microseconds are observed by intensity cross-correlation measurements. This storage period is two orders of magnitude longer than the time required to achieve conversion between photonic and atomic quanta. The controlled transfer of single quanta between remote quantum memories constitutes an important step towards distributed quantum networks.},

  abstract  = {A promising approach to merge atomic systems with scalable photonics has emerged recently, which consists of trapping cold atoms near tapered nanofibers. Here, we describe a novel technique to achieve strong, coherent coupling between a single atom and photon in such a system. Our approach makes use of collective enhancement effects, which allow a lattice of atoms to form a high-finesse cavity within the fiber. We show that a specially designated 'impurity' atom within the cavity can experience strongly enhanced interactions with single photons in the fiber. Under realistic conditions, a 'strong coupling' regime can be reached, wherein it becomes feasible to observe vacuum Rabi oscillations between the excited impurity atom and a single cavity quantum. This technique can form the basis for a scalable quantum information network using atom–nanofiber systems.},

Our scheme uses an optical probe tuned near the D1 transition to measure the sample birefringence, which depends on the z component of the collective pseudospin. At certain probe frequencies the differential light shift of the clock states vanishes, and the measurement is nonperturbing. In dense samples the measurement can be used to squeeze the collective clock pseudospin and has the potential to improve the performance of atomic clocks and interferometers.},

  abstract  = {We develop a self-consistent finite-element method to quantitatively study spontaneous emission from emitters in nanoscale proximity of plasmonic waveguides. In the model, it is assumed that only one guided mode is dominatingly excited by the quantum emitter, while the cross section of the plasmonic waveguide can be arbitrary. The fraction of the energy coupled to the plasmonic mode can be calculated exactly, which can be used to determine the efficiency with which single optical plasmons are generated. We apply our numerical method to calculate the coupling of a quantum emitter to a cylindrical metallic nanowire and a square metallic waveguide, and compare the cylindrical metallic nanowire with previous work that employs quasistatic approximation. For the cylindrical metallic nanowire we observe good agreement with the quasistatic approximation for radii below 10 nm, but for increasing radius the spontaneous emission β factor and the plasmonic decay rate deviate substantially, by factors of up to 5-10 for a radius of ~100 nm, from the values obtained in the quasistatic approximation. We also show that the quasistatic approximation is typically valid when the radius is less than the skin depth of the metals at optical frequencies. For the square metallic waveguide we estimate an optimized value for the spontaneous emission β factor up to 80%.},

The collective probing relies on obtaining a very large optical depth that can be effectively increased by placing the ensemble within an optical cavity such that the probe light passes many times through the ensemble. Here we provide expressions for measurement resolution and spectroscopic enhancement in such cavity-aided nondemolition measurements as a function of the cavity detuning. In particular, fundamental limits on spectroscopic enhancements in 87Rb are considered.},

The single-photon transport properties controlling by classic optical field are discussed. The critical coupling condition in the coupled waveguide-whispering-gallery resonator-atom with three-level system is also analyzed.},

Results from analyzing circular, elliptical, and cusp-shaped fibers are used to illustrate the general features of the method. A procedure is also given for improving the accuracy of the method applied to a class of single-mode fiber.},

  abstract  = {Understanding and controlling the complex environment of solid-state quantum bits is a central challenge in spintronics and quantum information science. Coherent manipulation of an individual electron spin associated with a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond was used to gain insight into its local environment. We show that this environment is effectively separated into a set of individual proximal 13C nuclear spins, which are coupled coherently to the electron spin, and the remainder of the 13C nuclear spins, which cause the loss of coherence. The proximal nuclear spins can be addressed and coupled individually because of quantum back-action from the electron, which modifies their energy levels and magnetic moments, effectively distinguishing them from the rest of the nuclei. These results open the door to coherent manipulation of individual isolated nuclear spins in a solid-state environment even at room temperature.},

  abstract  = {A critical requirement for diverse applications in quantum information science is the capability to disseminate quantum resources over complex quantum networks. For example, the coherent distribution of entangled quantum states together with quantum memory (for storing the states) can enable scalable architectures for quantum computation, communication and metrology. Here we report observations of entanglement between two atomic ensembles located in distinct, spatially separated set-ups. Quantum interference in the detection of a photon emitted by one of the samples projects the otherwise independent ensembles into an entangled state with one joint excitation stored remotely in 105 atoms at each site. After a programmable delay, we confirm entanglement by mapping the state of the atoms to optical fields and measuring mutual coherences and photon statistics for these fields. We thereby determine a quantitative lower bound for the entanglement of the joint state of the ensembles. Our observations represent significant progress in the ability to distribute and store entangled quantum states.},

Some interesting phenomena such as the multi-peak structure, extreme spectral narrowing, and cancellation of spontaneous emission can be observed by adjusting controllable system parameters. Moreover, these phenomena depend on the constructive or destructive quantum interference between multiple decay channels and which can be changed appreciably by varying the phase difference between the two circularly polarized components of the probe field. These results demonstrate the importance of an elliptically polarized laser field in controlling the spontaneous emission and its potential applications in high-precision spectroscopy.},

Accordingly, measures of energy, angular momentum, and chirality acquire a consistent interpretation. From the photonic nature of light, it emerges that an infinite hierarchy of spin-type measures depend on a difference in number operators for modes of opposing helicity, with pure circular polarization giving maximal values. Measures of orbital angular momentum are determined by a sum of corresponding number operators. Analysis of the electric and magnetic fields in the reflection of circular polarizations reveals regions of prominent chiral interference.},

We consider two such descriptions: (i) as a matrix product density operator of bond dimension D ; and (ii) as a purification that is written as a matrix product state of bond dimension D. We show that these descriptions are inequivalent in the sense that D cannot be upper bounded by D only. Then we provide two constructive methods to obtain (ii) out of (i). The sum of squares (sos) polynomial method scales exponentially in the number of different eigenvalues, and its approximate version is formulated as a semidefinite program, which gives efficient approximate purifications whose D only depends on D . The eigenbasis method scales quadratically in the number of eigenvalues, and its approximate version is very efficient for rapidly decaying distributions of eigenvalues. Our results imply that a description of mixed states which is both efficient and locally positive semidefinite does not exist, but that good approximations do.},

  abstract  = {We present an experimental demonstration of the Hamiltonian manipulation in light-atom interface in Raman-type warm rubidium-87 vapor atomic memory. By adjusting the detuning of the driving beam we varied the relative contributions of the Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering to the process of four-wave mixing which reads out a spatially multimode state of atomic memory. We measured the temporal evolution of the readout fields and the spatial intensity correlations between write-in and readout as a function of detuning with the use of an intensified camera. The correlation maps enabled us to resolve between the anti-Stokes and the Stokes scattering and to quantify their contributions. Our experimental results agree quantitatively with a simple, plane-wave theoretical model we provide. They allow for a simple interpretation of the coaction of the anti-Stokes and the Stokes scattering at the readout stage. The Stokes contribution yields additional, adjustable gain at the readout stage, albeit with inevitable extra noise. Here we provide a simple and useful framework to trace it and the results can be utilized in the existing atomic memories setups. Furthermore, the shown Hamiltonian manipulation offers a broad range of atom-light interfaces readily applicable in current and future quantum protocols with atomic ensembles.},

  abstract  = {We propose and demonstrate the use of narrow band optical parametric amplification for tunable slow and fast light propagation in optical fibers. The parametric gain is coupled to the Raman process which changes the gain value moderately but modifies the gain spectral shape. Consequently, the delay is enhanced at short wavelengths while it is moderated at long wavelengths. The maximum delay and tuning range can be optimized with respect to each other considering saturation effects in long fibers. The proposed scheme offers tunable delay in the presence of gain and with a bandwidth which is sufficiently wide to process digital data streams at tens of Gbit/s rates as well as picoseconds pulses.},

In particular, we discuss the trap performance in relation to laser-cooled rubidium atoms and show that a far off-resonance, blue-detuned field combined with the attractive surface-atom interaction potential from the dielectric material forms a stable trapping configuration. With the addition of a red-detuned field, we demonstrate how three dimensional confinement of the atoms at a distance of 140 00 nm from the fibre surface within the slot can be accomplished. This scheme facilitates optical coupling between the atoms and the nanofibre that could be exploited for quantum communication schemes using ensembles of laser-cooled atoms.},

Before discussing each of these topics the relevant theory is outlined at an introductory level with the emphasis on features relevant to understanding data. It is shown that a good understanding of the vibronic data is now available in diamond. Compared to defects in silicon, defects in diamond are less prone to static deformations, partly as a result of the high-energy transverse acoustic modes in diamond.},

For all cases, the computed resonances of the coupled system as function of the detuning show anti-crossings.The obtained mode splittings of coupled optical resonators are strongly depending on distance and cluster in almost degenerate eigenstates for large distances, as is known from coupled resonator optical waveguides.

A radially polarized surface wave is excited when a linearly polarized terahertz pulse is focused on the gap between the wire waveguide and another metal structure. We calculate the input coupling efficiency using a simulation based on the Finite Element Method (FEM). Additional FEM results indicate that enhanced coupling efficiency can be achieved through the use of a radially symmetric photoconductive antenna. Experimental results confirm that such an antenna can generate terahertz radiation which couples to the radial waveguide mode with greatly improved efficiency.},

  abstract  = {By using a discontinuous spectral element method, we analyze evanescent wave coupling of whispering gallery modes (WGMs) in microcylinder coupled resonator optical waveguides (CROWs). We demonstrate successful light propagation by WGMs through a chain of coupled cylinder resonators, and that the speed of such propagation is strongly dependent on the inter-resonator gap sizes. Our simulations also show that light propagates slower byWGMs with bigger azimuthal numbers than by those with smaller azimuthal numbers. On the other hand, the light propagation by WGMs of the same azimuthal number appears to have the same speed in CROWs regardless of the size and the material of the resonators, indicating that the tail (the part of a WGM outside the resonator) determines inter-resonator coupling strength.},

It leads to two types of quantum interference: reservoir-induced interference and laser-induced interference. Considering different detunings of atomic transition frequencies from band edges, we reveal some interesting phenomena such as spectral-line enhancement, spectral-line suppression, spectral-line narrowing, reservoir-induced cancellation of spontaneous emission and the appearance of dark lines, which originate from the quantum interference effects and the control of external laser fields. These investigations suggest possible applications in quantum optics, optical communications and in the fabrication of novel optoelectronic devices.},

In each of these developments, Rolf Landauer has played a crucial role in nudging us, and other workers in the field, into asking the right questions, some of which we have been lucky enough to answer. A general overview of the key ideas of quantum error correction is given. We discuss how quantum entanglement is the key to protecting quantum states from decoherence in a manner which, in a theoretical sense, is as effective as the protection of digital data from bit noise. We also discuss five general criteria which must be satisfied to implement a quantum computer in the laboratory, and we illustrate the application of these criteria by discussing our ideas for creating a quantum computer out of the spin states of coupled quantum dots.},

  abstract  = {Publisher Summary This chapter presents an overview of atom mirrors, resonators, waveguides, and traps that operate for the most part on the evanescent light-wave mechanism for atom manipulation. For many years, it has been known that light can be used to trap and manipulate small dielectric particles and atoms. In particular, the intense coherent light of lasers has been used to cool neutral atoms down to the micro-Kelvin and now even the nano-Kelvin regimes. The chapter discusses several convex, evanescent light-wave traps or guides in which at least one field is red-detuned, and hence attractive but a centrifugal force or a blue-detuned field provides a repulsive counterforce to allow the atoms to remain confined in stable orbits around the convex, dielectric, and optical resonator. The chapter focuses on the use of the evanescent field for making atom mirrors, resonators, waveguides, and traps. One of the principal experimental drawbacks of the evanescent light-wave mirror is that it requires quite high laser power to produce a sufficiently large potential barrier to reflect atoms with any realistic component of velocity normal to the surface, while not introducing an unacceptable degree of spontaneous emission probability.},

  abstract  = {The perfectly matched layer (PML) is nowadays considered as the best optimum absorbing boundary condition available. However, the PML with the classical stretching tensor has certain limitations. Strangely, these limitations have rarely been addressed in elastic wave modelling. For example, substantial reflections occur when strong evanescent waves are propagating parallel to the interface. To circumvent problems like this, the complex frequency shifted stretching tensor has been introduced in electromagnetic modelling. In this paper we show that the convolution PML with this stretching tensor as used in electromagnetic modelling can be adapted for elastic wave modelling. Numerical results of a model where the presence of evanescent waves is predominant show that the PML based on the complex frequency shifted stretching tensor can improve the performance of the absorbing boundary layer considerably.},

Using the theory of cumulants, their unbiased estimators, and the uncertainties of these estimators, we describe a quantification which is simultaneously efficient, unbiased by measurement noise, and suitable for hypothesis tests, e.g., to detect nonclassical states. The theory is applied to cold Rb87 spin ensembles prepared in non-Gaussian states by optical pumping and measured by nondestructive Faraday rotation probing. We find an optimal use of measurement resources under realistic conditions, e.g., in atomic ensemble quantum memories.},

From a theoretical point of view, we show that the overall fluorescence collection efficiency using a moderate numerical aperture microscope objective can be enhanced by using a low-quality-factor microcavity. This could be used in particular for low-temperature applications, where the numerical aperture of collection microscope objectives is limited due to the experimental constraints. We experimentally investigate the control of the fluorescence spectrum of the emitted light from a single center. We show the simultaneous narrowing of the room temperature broadband emission spectrum and the increase in the fluorescence spectral density.},

  abstract  = {Preparation, manipulation and detection of strongly correlated states of quantum many-body systems are among the most important goals and challenges of modern physics. Ultracold atoms offer an unprecedented playground for the realization of these goals. Here, we propose a method for detecting strongly correlated states of ultracold atoms in a quantum non-demolition scheme, that is, in the fundamentally least destructive way permitted by quantum mechanics. In our method, spatially resolved components of atomic spins couple to quantum polarization degrees of freedom of light. In this way, quantum correlations of matter are faithfully mapped on those of light; the latter can then be efficiently measured using homodyne detection. We illustrate the power of such spatially resolved quantum-noise-limited polarization measurement by applying this method to the detection of various standard and `exotic' types of antiferromagnetic order in lattice systems, and by indicating the feasibility of detection of superfluid order in Fermi liquids.},

  abstract  = {Techniques to facilitate controlled interactions between single photons and atoms are now being actively explored. These techniques are important for the practical realization of quantum networks, in which multiple memory nodes that utilize atoms for generation, storage and processing of quantum states are connected by single-photon transmission in optical fibres. One promising avenue for the realization of quantum networks involves the manipulation of quantum pulses of light in optically dense atomic ensembles using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT, refs 8, 9). EIT is a coherent control technique that is widely used for controlling the propagation of classical, multi-photon light pulses in applications such as efficient nonlinear optics. Here we demonstrate the use of EIT for the controllable generation, transmission and storage of single photons with tunable frequency, timing and bandwidth. We study the interaction of single photons produced in a 'source' ensemble of 87Rb atoms at room temperature with another 'target' ensemble. This allows us to simultaneously probe the spectral and quantum statistical properties of narrow-bandwidth single-photon pulses, revealing that their quantum nature is preserved under EIT propagation and storage. We measure the time delay associated with the reduced group velocity of the single-photon pulses and report observations of their storage and retrieval.},

Both the weakly guiding case in which n1 $\approx$ n2 and the general case of arbitrary index difference are discussed theoretically. In both cases the approach is to derive integral representations for appropriate components of E and B. These satisfy the appropriate Helmholtz equations inside and outside the guide and also guarantee that the boundary conditions are satisfied. On expansion of the components in certain sets of basis functions, the representations become a set of linear equations. The vanishing of the determinant of this set yields the propagation constants of the various mqdes. Numerical results are given for weakly guiding fibers of various shapes. Among these are rectangles and ellipses, which make comparisons with previous work possible.},

  abstract  = {Recent theory has predicted a superlens that is capable of producing sub-diffraction-limited images. This superlens would allow the recovery of evanescent waves in an image via the excitation of surface plasmons. Using silver as a natural optical superlens, we demonstrated sub-diffraction-limited imaging with 60-nanometer half-pitch resolution, or one-sixth of the illumination wavelength. By proper design of the working wavelength and the thickness of silver that allows access to a broad spectrum of subwavelength features, we also showed that arbitrary nanostructures can be imaged with good fidelity. The optical superlens promises exciting avenues to nanoscale optical imaging and ultrasmall optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract  = {The field of integrated plasmonics is multifaceted in a way that few other disciplines in applied science are, mainly due to its intrinsic \&\#x201C;hybrid\&\#x201D; nature of combining materials and strategies borrowed from electronics and photonics. Because of the multitude of angles under which the plasmonic world could be analyzed, and also because of the intrinsic interest behind this branch of physics, numerous review papers have been recently published with the attempt to exhaustively describe this subject and its possible future developments. However, despite the considerable literature already available, a few important aspects deserve a deeper investigation. Among these dark spots we find the lack of a general overview of active plasmonics, specifically focused on the possibility to dynamically alter the optical properties of the constituent plasmonic materials in order to gain full active control over the overall desired functionality. The present review focuses on the possibility to tune the optical properties of said components, deliberately neglecting those strategies relying on the dynamic properties of the dielectric constituent. The present work also will attempt to outline experimental and multidisciplinary aspects of tunable plasmonic devices, giving only a marginal overview of telecom applications, for which considerable literature is already available.},

  abstract  = {Free-electron lasers (FELs) have been built ranging in wavelength from long-wavelength oscillators using partial wave guiding through ultraviolet through hard x-ray that are either seeded or start from noise. In addition, FELs that produce different polarizations of the output radiation ranging from linear through elliptic to circular polarization are currently under study. In this paper, we develop a three-dimensional, time-dependent formulation that is capable of modeling this large variety of FEL configurations including different polarizations. We employ a modal expansion for the optical field, i.e., a Gaussian expansion with variable polarization for free-space propagation. This formulation uses the full Newton–Lorentz force equations to track the particles through the optical and magnetostatic fields. As a result, arbitrary three-dimensional representations for different undulator configurations are implemented, including planar, helical, and elliptical undulators. In particular, we present an analytic model of an APPLE-II undulator to treat arbitrary elliptical polarizations, which is used to treat general elliptical polarizations. To model oscillator configurations, and allow propagation of the optical field outside the undulator and interact with optical elements, we link the FEL simulation with the optical propagation code OPC. We present simulations using the APPLE-II undulator model to produce elliptically polarized output radiation, and present a detailed comparison with recent experiments using a tapered undulator configuration at the Linac Coherent Light Source. Validation of the nonlinear formation is also shown by comparison with experimental results obtained in the Sorgente Pulsata Auto-amplificata di Radiazione Coerente SASE FEL experiment at ENEA Frascati, a seeded tapered amplifier experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory, and the 10 kW upgrade oscillator experiment at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility.},

  abstract  = {Abstract The Feynman tools have been re-designed with the goal to establish and implement a high-level (computer) language that is capable to deal with the physics of finite, n -qubit systems, from frequently required computations to mathematically advanced tasks in quantum information processing. In particular, emphasis has been placed to introduce a small but powerful set of keystring-driven commands in order to support both, symbolic and numerical computations. Though the current design is implemented again within the framework of Maple, it is general and flexible enough to be utilized and combined with other languages and computational environments. The present implementation facilitates a large number of computational tasks, including the definition, manipulation and parametrization of quantum states, the evaluation of quantum measures and quantum operations, the evolution of quantum noise in discrete models, quantum measurements and state estimation, and several others. The design is based on a few high-level commands, with a syntax close to the mathematical notation and its use in the literature, and which can be generalized quite readily in order to solve computational tasks at even higher degree of complexity. In this work, I present and discuss the (re-design of the) Feynman tools and make major parts of the code available for public use. Moreover, a few selected examples are shown and demonstrate possible application of this toolbox. The Feynman tools are provided as Maple library and can hence be used on all platforms on which this computer-algebra system is accessible. Program summary Program title: \{FEYNMAN\} Catalogue identifier: AESG_v1_0 Program summary URL:http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AESG_v1_0.html Program obtainable from: \{CPC\} Program Library, Queen’s University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: Standard \{CPC\} licence, http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/licence/licence.html No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 22626 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 859217 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: Maple 15 and 16. Computer: Any computer capable of running the Maple package. Operating system: Suse and Ubuntu Linux. Typical time and memory requirements: Most commands respond promptly or require less than a few seconds on a standard processor if invoked with quantum states and registers of four or less qubits. In addition to the memory for using the Maple machinery, about 5 0 \{MB\} or working memory is typically sufficient to deal with standard (floating-point) computations. When working with symbolic expressions or some large number of qubits ( n \$>$ 5 ) , however, the requirements of cpu time and memory depend critically on the size and complexity of the expressions involved. Although Maple’s assume feature may sometimes help reduce the complexity of symbolic expressions, more often than not, only numerical computations are feasible for sizeable expressions or a larger number of qubits. Since most commands can be readily applied to quite different computational scenarios, no general scaling rule can be given for the requested cpu time or memory. Classification: 4.15. Nature of problem: Quantum information processing and quantum control require a careful preparation and analysis of quantum states. For such an analysis and for implementing new protocols, various computational tasks need to be performed frequently, such as the construction, manipulation and estimation of quantum states, the display of quantum amplitudes and probability distributions, the evaluation of quantum measures and quantum operations, the decomposition of operators into different representations, or the simulation of quantum measurements, to name just a few. Solution method: To support a large number of computational tasks in dealing with n -qubit quantum states and quantum registers, a high-level (computer-) language is designed and implemented within the framework of the computer-algebra system Maple. This design is based on a set of keystring-driven commands in order to provide a flexible, interactive and user-friendly environment for quantum computations on finite n -qubit systems. The present design provides high-level commands (procedures) that can be utilized in order to simulate reversible and irreversible quantum computations. Though the use of Maple has been found versatile to access a wealth of (additional) in-built mathematical functions, the re-design of the \{FEYNMAN\} tools is general and flexible enough to be implemented (or combined) with other languages and computational environments. Restrictions: Restrictions in the manipulation of n -qubit quantum states mainly arise from the complexity and stability of certain algebraic and numerical computations. For example, the symbolic analysis of noise models (as defined by means of the known Kraus operators) often leads to large expressions that slow down all subsequent computations. Owing to the exponential increase of complexity with the number of qubits involved, many computational tasks are limited to about 4 qubits on a standard processor, although some larger number of qubits might become feasible by using Maple’s parallel features or some link to specially designed code in Matlab, C or Fortran. Unusual features: The \{FEYNMAN\} tools [1] have been re-designed within the framework of Maple to provide a small but very powerful set of keystring-driven commands for symbolic and numerical simulations of (finite) n -qubit systems. Emphasis was placed especially on establishing a set of (about 15 0) high-level commands that are suitable to deal with most common tasks from quantum information theory, and which can be applied also interactively. Whenever possible, both representations of quantum registers in terms of their state vectors and/or density matrices are equally supported by the program, and with no other restrictions than those given by the memory and processor resources of the computer. All commands of the \{FEYNMAN\} tools are organized in an hierarchical order and can be utilized as language elements in order to perform tasks at even higher level of complexity. Moreover, the design and syntax of this toolbox may serve as a model to apply computer-algebraic techniques to other fields in science and technology. Additional comments: For the original \{FEYNMAN\} programs see http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/ADWE_v1_0.html [1] to http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/ADWE_v5_0.html Running time: About 2 min on a standard laptop for all test cases below.

  abstract  = {Using a Green tensor formalism, we perform a comprehensive investigation into the spontaneous emission decay rate and energy-level shift in a circular dielectric waveguide. The two-dimensional (2D) Green tensor for an embedded line source and 3D Green tensor for a point source are obtained by a combination of Fourier integral and multipole methods. We fully characterize resonant states, which include whispering gallery modes, and examine the associated cavitylike effects. The quality factor of resonant states increases with frequency, resulting in a strongly enhanced decay rate and a large anomalous level shift in both the 2D and 3D cases.},

The second principle determines the geometry and then a new logic for describing the history of events (Feynman's paths) that modifies the rules of classical probabilistic calculus. The notion of classical trajectory is replaced by a history of spontaneous, random an discontinuous events. So the theory is reduced to determin- ing the probability distribution for such histories according with the symmetries of the system. The representation of the logic in terms of amplitudes leads to Feynman rules and, alternatively, its representation in terms of projectors results in the Schwinger trace formula.},

  abstract   = {We develop a formulation of quantum damping theory in which the explicit nature of inputs from a heat bath, and of outputs into it, is taken into account. Quantum Langevin equations are developed, in which the Langevin forces are the field operators corresponding to the input modes. Time-reversed equations exist in which the Langevin forces are the output modes, and the sign of damping is reversed. Causality and boundary conditions relating inputs to system variables are developed. The concept of "quantum white noise" is formulated, and the formal relationship between quantum Langevin equations and quantum stochastic differential equations (SDE's) is established. In analogy to the classical formulation, there are two kinds of SDE's: the Ito and the Stratonovich forms. Rules are developed for converting from one to the other. These rules depend on the nature of the quantum white noise, which may be squeezed. The SDE's developed are shown to be exactly equivalent to quantum master equations, and rules are developed for computing multitime-ordered correlation functions with use of the appropriate master equation. With use of the causality and boundary conditions, the relationship between correlation functions of the output and those of the system and the input is developed. It is possible to calculate what kind of output statistics result, provided that one knows the input statistics and provided that one can compute the system correlation functions.},

  abstract  = {This article focuses on the general theory of open quantum systems in the Gaussian regime and explores a number of diverse ramifications and consequences of the theory. We shall first introduce the Gaussian framework in its full generality, including a classification of Gaussian (also known as ‘general-dyne ) quantum measurements. In doing so, we will give a compact proof for the parametrisation of the most general Gaussian completely positive map, which we believe to be missing in the existing literature. We will then move on to consider the linear coupling with a white noise bath, and derive the diffusion equations that describe the evolution of Gaussian states under such circumstances. Starting from these equations, we outline a constructive method to derive general master equations that apply outside the Gaussian regime. Next, we include the general-dyne monitoring of the environmental degrees of freedom and recover the Riccati equation for the conditional evolution of Gaussian states. Our derivation relies exclusively on the standard quantum mechanical update of the system state, through the evaluation of Gaussian overlaps. The parametrisation of the conditional dynamics we obtain is novel and, at variance with existing alternatives, directly ties in to physical detection schemes. We conclude our study with two examples of conditional dynamics that can be dealt with conveniently through our formalism, demonstrating how monitoring can suppress the noise in optical parametric processes as well as stabilise systems subject to diffusive scattering.},

This model is employed to calculate the effects of size disorder on propagation losses in linear photonic crystal waveguides as well as on quality (Q)-factors in photonic crystal nano-cavities. The main results obtained by the present theory and shown in this work are: (a) large single-mode bandwidth and low-loss (0.1[thin space]dB/mm) propagation of light is predicted for increased-width membrane-type photonic crystal waveguides, (b) pillar-based lattices show reduced sensitivity to size fluctuations than hole-based ones, (c) the effects of disorder on cavity Q-factors are quantitatively evaluated. An extension of the model is also introduced in order to take into account the side-wall micro-roughness of the perfectly vertical holes, and preliminary results of this more general approach are discussed.},

  abstract  = {Generally, the total power attenuation in multimode evanescent-field sensor waveguides is nonproportional to the bulk absorbance because the modal attenuation constants differ. Hence a direct measurement is difficult and is additionally aggravated because the waveguide absorbance is highly sensitive to the specific launching conditions at the waveguide input. A general asymptotic formula for the modal power attenuation in strongly asymmetric inhomogeneous planar waveguides with arbitrarily distributed weak absorption in the low-index superstrate is derived. Explicit expressions for typical refractive-index profiles are given. Except when very close to the cutoff, the predicted asymptotic attenuation behavior agrees well with exact calculations. The ratio of TM versus TE absorption has been derived to be (2 {\textminus} n02/nf2) for arbitrary profiles. Waveguides with a linear refractive-index profile show mode-independent attenuation coefficients within each polarization. Further, the asymptotic sensitivity is independent of the wavelength, so that it should be possible to directly measure the spectral variation of the bulk absorption. The mode independence of the attenuation has been verified experimentally for a second-order polynomial profile, which is close to a linear refractive-index distribution. In contrast, the attenuation in the step-profile waveguide has been found to depend strongly on the mode number, as predicted by theory. A strong spread of the modal attenuation coefficients is also predicted for the parabolic-profile waveguide sensor.},

  abstract     = {The integration of nanophotonics and atomic physics has been a long-sought goal that would open new frontiers for optical physics, including novel quantum transport and many-body phenomena with photon-mediated atomic interactions. Reaching this goal requires surmounting diverse challenges in nanofabrication and atomic manipulation. Here we report the development of a novel integrated optical circuit with a photonic crystal capable of both localizing and interfacing atoms with guided photons. Optical bands of a photonic crystal waveguide are aligned with selected atomic transitions. From reflection spectra measured with average atom number , we infer that atoms are localized within the waveguide by optical dipole forces. The fraction of single-atom radiative decay into the waveguide is Γ1D/Γ′≃(0.32±0.08), where Γ1D is the rate of emission into the guided mode and Γ' is the decay rate into all other channels. Γ1D/Γ' is unprecedented in all current atom–photon interfaces.},

Our calculations show that the hyperfine interaction in the 15 N–V center is capable of mediating such a transition. We use a density matrix approach to describe the exact dynamics for the allowed optical spin non-conserving transitions between two sublevels of the ground state triplet. This approach allows us to calculate the Rabi oscillations, by means of which we obtain a Rabi frequency with an upper bound determined by the hyperfine interaction. This result is crucial for the success of implementing optically driven quantum information processing with the N–V center in diamond.},

We demonstrate a primitive nanophotonic integrated circuit element composed of a single silver nanowire and single-layer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) flake. Using scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy and spectroscopy, we find that nanowire plasmons can excite MoS2 photoluminescence and that MoS2 excitons can decay into nanowire plasmons. Finally, we show that the nanowire may serve the dual purpose of both exciting MoS2 photoluminescence via plasmons and recollecting the decaying exciton as nanowire plasmons. The potential for subwavelength light guiding and strong nanoscale light\&\#x2013;matter interaction afforded by our device may facilitate compact and efficient on-chip optical processing.},

By interfacing a tapered optical nanofiber with a cold atomic ensemble, electromagnetically induced transparency is observed and light pulses at the single-photon level are stored in and retrieved from the atomic medium. The decay of efficiency with storage time is also measured and related to concurrent decoherence mechanisms. Collapses and revivals can be additionally controlled by an applied magnetic field. Our results based on subdiffraction-limited optical mode interacting with atoms via the strong evanescent field demonstrate an alternative to free-space focusing and a novel capability for information storage in an all-fibered quantum network.},

  abstract  = {We study control of the temporal profile of the local electric field in the vicinity of a small doped semiconductor or metal nanostructure. Unlike in the case of control in a gas or liquid phase, the collective response of electrons in the nanostructure may significantly enhance different frequency components of the external field. This enhancement strongly depends on the geometry of the nanostructure and can substantially modify the temporal profile of the local field. The changes in the amplitude and phase of the local field are studied using linear response theory within the random phase approximation. The inverse problem of finding the external electromagnetic field to generate an arbitrary target temporal profile of the local field, including the time-dependent polarization of the field, is considered and solved. We systematically study the pulse enhancement and shape distortion effects for a set of control pulses of various shapes.},

  abstract  = {A complete physical approach to quantum information requires a robust interface among flying qubits, long-lifetime memory, and computational qubits. Here we present a unified interface for microwave and optical photons, potentially connecting engineerable quantum devices such as superconducting qubits at long distances through optical photons. Our approach uses an ultracold ensemble of atoms for two purposes: quantum memory and to transduce excitations between the two frequency domains. Using coherent control techniques, we examine an approach for converting and storing quantum information between microwave photons in superconducting resonators, ensembles of ultracold atoms, and optical photons, as well as a method for transferring information between two resonators.},

Discussions are mainly focused on the manipulation of spontaneous emission for atoms around the nanofiber. We show that photons from single quantum emitters can be efficiently channeled into guided modes of the nanofiber. Especially by fabricating a cavity structure of the nanofiber, the channeling efficiency can be improved to exceed 80% although the cavity finesse is moderate. We discuss also how to realize such a nanofiber cavity experimentally.},

These forces show resonances at dipolar plasmon wavelengths, similar to resonances in the near-field electromagnetic intensities. At MW/cm intensities, optical forces can be stronger than van der Waals forces and could be used to organize metallic particles. We also suggest that photonucleation of organic crystals from supersaturated liquid solutions may be caused by optical forces.},

  abstract  = {Single photon emitters coupled to optical fibers are becoming important as sources of non-classical light and nano-scale sensors. At present it is not possible to efficiently interface single photon emitters with the optical fiber platform, and there are particular challenges associated with the need to ensure highly efficient collection and delivery of emitted photons. To model single particle emission, we have considered the coupling of a dipole to an optical fiber mode as a function of orientation and position with respect to the core-cladding interface. Our model shows that it is possible to significantly enhance the collection efficiency into the guided modes as a result of modifications to the dipole emission pattern and power resulting from the surrounding fiber environment. For certain geometries the fiber-dipole coupling can result in a factor of 2.6 increase in the power emitted by the dipole.},

  abstract  = {The goal of our research program is to develop competitive and sandwich fluoroimmunoassays with high sensitivity and fast response time, that do not require external reagents. Our approach to this problem is to employ an optical immunoassay based on total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF). Specifically, monoclonal antibodies are immobilized on a planar waveguide. Total internal reflection of light in the planar waveguide sets up an evanescent field which extends about 2000 angstroms from the interface. In the competitive immunoassay, a fluorescent label is coupled to a small synthetic antigen which is packaged with the antibody. In the absence of analyte, the fluorescently labeled antigen binds to the antibody and is excited by the evanescent field. Upon the addition of analyte, the fluorescently labeled antigen molecules are displaced by unlabeled antigen molecules and diffuse out of the evanescent field. In the sandwich assay, a primary or `capture' antibody is immobilized on the planar waveguide, and a secondary or `tracer' antibody (which is labeled with a fluorescent dye) is added to the bulk solution. In the absence of analyte, the tracer antibody remains in solution and very little fluorescence is observed. However, upon addition of analyte, a `molecular sandwich' is formed on the waveguide, composed of: (1) the capture antibody; (2) the analyte; and (3) the tracer antibody. Once this sandwich forms, the tracer antibody is within the evanescent field and fluoresces. Fluorescence emission is detected by a charged- coupled device (CCD). Using this approach, we have developed a prototype immunosensor for the detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). This device meets our design goals and exhibits a sensitivity of 0.1 - 1 pmolar.},

  abstract  = {For the last decade it has been possible to cool atoms to microkelvin temperatures (~1 cm s -1 ) using a variety of optical techniques. Light beams provide the very strong frictional forces required to slow atoms from room temperature (~500 m s -1 ). However, once the atoms are cold, the relatively weak conservative forces of static electric and magnetic fields play an important role. In our group we have been studying the interaction of cold rubidium atoms with periodically magnetized data storage media. Here we review the underlying principles of the forces acting on atoms above a suitably magnetized substrate or near current-carrying wires. We also summarize the status of experiments. These structures can be used as smooth or corrugated reflectors for controlling the trajectories of cold atoms. Alternatively, they may be used to confine atoms to a plane, a line, or a dot and in some cases to reach the quantum limit of confinement. Atoms levitated above a magnetized surface can be guided electrostatically by wires deposited on the surface. The flow and interaction of atoms in such a structure may form the basis of a new technology, `integrated atom optics' which might ultimately be capable of realizing a quantum computer.},

  abstract    = {This chapter discusses an ab initio frequency domain model of circular microresonators, built on the physical notions that commonly enter the description of the resonator functioning in terms of interaction between fields in the circular cavity with the modes supported by the straight bus waveguides. Quantitative evaluation of this abstract model requires propagation constants associated with the cavity/bend segments, and scattering matrices, that represent the wave interaction in the coupler regions. These quantities are obtained by an analytical (2-D) or numerical (3-D) treatment of bent waveguides, along with spatial coupled mode theory (CMT) for the couplers. The required CMT formulation is described in detail. Also, quasi-analytical approximations for fast and accurate computation of the resonator spectra are discussed. The formalism discussed in this chapter provides valuable insight into the functioning of the resonators, and it is suitable for practical device design.},

When controllably launching the next family of higher-order modes on a fiber with 195 mm stretch, we achieve a transmission of 97.8 ± 2.8%, which has a loss from tapering of 5.0  × 10-4 dB/mm when normalized to the entire stretch. Our pulling and transfer procedures allow us to fabricate optical nanofibers that transmit more than 400 mW in high vacuum conditions. These results, published as parameters in our previous work, present an improvement of two orders of magnitude less loss for the fundamental mode and an increase in transmission of more than 300% for higher-order modes, when following the protocols detailed in this paper. We extract from the transmission during the pull, the only reported spectrogram of a fundamental mode launch that does not include excitation to asymmetric modes; in stark contrast to a pull in which our cleaning protocol is not followed. These results depend critically on the pre-pull cleanliness and when properly following our pulling protocols are in excellent agreement with simulations.},

The standard \{FD\} scheme is appropriately modified to capture all discontinuities, due to the change of the refractive index, across the waveguides interfaces taking into account the shape of each interface at the same time. The method is applied to the vector Helmholtz equation formulated to describe the electric or magnetic fields in the waveguide (one field is retrieved from the other through Maxwell’s equations). Computational cost is kept to a minimum by exploiting sparse matrix algebra. The waveguides under study have arbitrary cross sectional shape and arbitrary refractive index profile.},

  abstract  = {Computational methods for determining the complex propagation constants of leaky waveguide modes have become so powerful and so readily available that it is possible to use these methods with little understanding of what they are calculating. We compare different computational methods for calculating the propagation constants of the leaky modes, focusing on the relatively simple context of a W-type slab waveguide. In a lossless medium with infinite transverse extent, a direct determination of the leaky mode by using mode matching is compared with complete mode decomposition. The mode matching method is analogous to the multipole method in two dimensions. We then compare these results with a simple finite-difference scheme in a transverse region with absorbing boundaries that is analogous to finite-difference or finite-element methods in two dimensions. While the physical meaning of the leaky modes in these different solution methods is different, they all predict a nearly identical evolution for an initial, nearly confined mode profile over a limited spatial region and a limited distance. Finally, we demonstrate that a waveguide that uses bandgap confinement with a central defect produces analogous results.},

A new hybrid trap is analyzed that combines optical and Casimir–Polder forces to form stable traps for neutral atoms in dielectric nanostructures. By suitable design of the band structure, the atomic spontaneous emission rate into the probe mode can exceed the rate into all other modes by more than tenfold. The unprecedented single-atom reflectivity r 0 ≳ 0.9 for the guided probe field should enable diverse investigations of photon-mediated interactions for 1D atom chains and cavity quantum electrodynamics.},

Microfluidic channels of 100 [small micro]m width and 210[small micro]m depth were fabricated in the optical fibers using a direct-write CO laser system. The experimental results show that the sensor has high sensitivity{,} able to detect 0.005 [small micro]g L of fluorescein in the PBS solution{,} and the results are reproducible. The results also show that the silica fiber sensor has better sensitivity than that of the PMMA fiber sensor. This could be due to the fouling effect of the frosty layer formed at the microchannel made within the PMMA fiber. It is believed that this fiber sensor has the potential to be integrated into microfluidic chips for lab-on-a-chip applications.},

  abstract  = {Publisher Summary This chapter reviews the experimental and theoretical developments made in the study of optical lattices. The interference pattern of a set of intersecting laser beams can create a stable periodic potential for neutral atoms through the ac Stark shift (light shift), which can trap, and thereby organize atoms in an ordered, crystal-like structure. Historically, interest in these 鈥渙ptical lattices鈥� grew out of the study of laser cooling. The chapter introduces this subject by discussing the key one-dimensional model system for laser cooling and trapping in optical lattices. It discusses the crystallography of various lattice geometries and details the basic laser cooling theory in optical lattices. The chapter reviews experimental work that probes optical lattices through spectroscopy and discusses new developments made in the field, along with possible future directions. Aside from its role as a model system for laser cooling, the motion of atoms in an optical lattice is closely analogous to that of an electron in a solid-state crystal. This situation offers unique opportunities to explore phenomena that were previously accessible only in condensed matter.},

  abstract       = {Simple examples are used to introduce and examine a Heisenberg picture of symmetries of open quantum dynamics that can be described by unitary operators. When the symmetries are for Hamiltonian dynamics of an entire system, and the spectrum of the Hamiltonian operator has a lower bound, the symmetry operators commute with the Hamiltonian operator. An example shows that symmetry operators need not commute with the Hamiltonian operator when the spectrum of the Hamiltonian does not have a lower bound. There are many more symmetries that are only for the open dynamics of a subsystem and are described by unitary operators that do not commute with the Hamiltonian for the dynamics of the entire system. Examples show how these symmetries alone can reveal properties of the dynamics and reduce what needs to be done to work out the dynamics. A symmetry of the open dynamics of a subsystem can imply properties of the dynamics for the entire system that are not implied by the symmetries of the dynamics of the entire system. The symmetries are generally not related to constants of the motion for the open dynamics of the subsystem. There are symmetries of the open dynamics of a subsystem that depend only on the dynamics. In the simplest examples, these are also symmetries of the dynamics of the entire system. There are many more symmetries, of a new kind, that also depend on correlations, or absence of correlations, between the subsystem and the rest of the entire system, or on the state of the rest of the entire system. Symmetries that depend on correlations generally cannot be seen in the Schr\"{o}dinger picture as symmetries of dynamical maps of density matrices for the subsystem.},

  abstract  = {Entanglement is considered to be one of the most profound features of quantum mechanics. An entangled state of a system consisting of two subsystems cannot be described as a product of the quantum states of the two subsystems. In this sense, the entangled system is considered inseparable and non-local. It is generally believed that entanglement is usually manifest in systems consisting of a small number of microscopic particles. Here we demonstrate experimentally the entanglement of two macroscopic objects, each consisting of a caesium gas sample containing about 1012 atoms. Entanglement is generated via interaction of the samples with a pulse of light, which performs a non-local Bell measurement on the collective spins of the samples. The entangled spin-state can be maintained for 0.5 milliseconds. Besides being of fundamental interest, we expect the robust and long-lived entanglement of material objects demonstrated here to be useful in quantum information processing, including teleportation of quantum states of matter and quantum memory.},

  abstract  = {A metal−dielectric−metal (MDM) waveguide with a nanoscale gap supports highly confined surface plasmon−polariton modes, termed gap plasmons. The spontaneous emission of an emitter placed in such a metal nanogap is expected to be strongly modified due to coupling to gap plasmons. We investigate the light emission properties of semiconductor quantum dots (QD) in a metal nanoslit, which is a truncated MDM waveguide. More specifically, we measure both the lifetime and the state of polarization of the out-coupled QD emission from a metal nanoslit. We observe clear lifetime and polarization changes of QD emission. As the slit width gets smaller, the QD exciton lifetime gradually decreases, and its emission becomes polarized normal to the slit, as expected for gap plasmon coupled light emission. We also find that the polarization of the collected QD emission is flipped (i.e., becomes parallel to a slit) when the excited emitters are located just outside the slit. We have conducted dipole emission calculations in metal nanoslits, and these explain the experimentally observed lifetime and polarization changes well. These findings may have novel applications in nanoscale optical sources, sensors, and active devices.},

However, there is alack of unambiguous, pure experimental methods in contrast to numericalphase-retrieval routines, mainly because of the difficulty to characterizethe phase structure properly, e.g. if it contains singularities. This paperpresents novel results for the complete modal decomposition of opticalfields by using computer-generated holographic filters. The suitability ofthis method is proven by reconstructing various fields emerging from aweakly multi-mode fiber (V $\approx$ 5) with arbitrary mode contents. Advantagesof this approach are its mathematical uniqueness and its experimentalsimplicity. The method constitutes a promising technique for real-timebeam characterization, even for singular beam profiles.},

In recent years optical tomography has been combined with digital holography and has been employed to produce high-quality images of phase objects such as cells. In this paper we describe a method for imaging 3D phase objects in a tomographic configuration implemented by training an artificial neural network to reproduce the complex amplitude of the experimentally measured scattered light. The network is designed such that the voxel values of the refractive index of the 3D object are the variables that are adapted during the training process. We demonstrate the method experimentally by forming images of the 3D refractive index distribution of Hela cells.},

  abstract  = {A multichannel thin-film optical waveguide sensor for determining aqueous biochemical concentration with a high dynamic range of measurement is proposed. The sensitivity dependence of the proposed sensor on interaction length and waveguide thickness is investigated for dye solutions and three different hemoglobin concentration levels of carboxyhemoglobins. The sensitivity is inversely proportional to the waveguide thickness while proportional to the interaction length. As a consequence the variability of the interaction length makes the proposed sensor a flexible tool for concentration measurements. Moreover, an efficient method for determining the absorption coefficient is discussed.},

  abstract  = {We employed a coupled dipole method (CDM) to study theoretically the interaction among several spherical particles placed into two counter-propagating mutually incoherent Bessel beams. This interaction is mediated by the light scattering among the particles. It has already been demonstrated that, if the intensity of the incident beam is sufficiently high, the scattered light is strong enough to self-arrange the objects in the space. Namely, the counter-propagating and incoherent Bessel beams are extremely useful to be employed because the interaction among the particles via the scattered light is not superimposed by other optical forces coming from the radiation pressure of each beam and axial gradients of the beam intensities. Therefore so-called optical binding between the particles is enhanced and leads to several stable configurations of the particles. We studied these stable configurations using the CDM for various properties of the beams and particles and we also compared these theoretical results with the experimental observations.},

  abstract  = {We discuss the feasibility of negative refraction with reduced absorption in coherently driven atomic media. Coherent coupling of an electric and a magnetic dipole transition by laser fields induces magnetoelectric cross coupling and negative refraction at dipole densities which are considerably smaller than necessary to achieve a negative permeability. At the same time the absorption gets minimized due to destructive quantum interference and the ratio of negative refraction index to absorption becomes orders of magnitude larger than in systems without coherent cross coupling. The proposed scheme allows for a fine tuning of the refractive index. We derive a generalized expression for the impedance of a medium with magnetoelectric cross coupling and show that impedance matching to vacuum can easily be achieved. Finally we discuss the tensorial properties of the medium response and derive expressions for the dependence of the refractive index on the propagation direction.},

  abstract  = {We present a single calcium ion, coupled to a high-finesse cavity, as an almost ideal system for the controlled generation of single photons. Photons from a pump beam are Raman-scattered by the ion into the cavity mode, which subsequently emits the photon into a well-defined output channel. In contrast with comparable atomic systems, the ion is localized at a fixed position in the cavity mode for indefinite times, enabling truly continuous operation of the device. We have performed numeric calculations to assess the performance of the system and present the first experimental indication of single-photon emission in our set-up.},

  abstract  = {The well-known momentum conservation theorem is derived specifically for time-harmonic fields and is applied to calculate the radiation pressure on 2-D particles modeled as infinite dielectric and magnetic cylinders. The force calculation results from the divergence of the Maxwell stress tensor and is compared favorably via examples with the direct application of Lorentz force to bound currents and charges. The application of the momentum conservation theorem is shown to have the advantage of less computation, reducing the surface integration of the Lorentz force density to a line integral of the Maxwell stress tensor. The Lorentz force is applied to compute the force density throughout the particles, which demonstrates regions of compression and tension within the medium. Further comparison of the two force calculation methods is provided by the calculation of radiation pressure on a magnetic particle, which has not been previously published. The fields are found by application of th},

Bit commitment has many applications, and has been much studied, but completely and provably secure schemes have remained elusive. Here we report a new development in physics-based cryptography which gives a completely new way of implementing bit commitment that is perfectly secure. The technique involves sending a quantum state (for instance one or more photons) at light speed in one of two or more directions, either along a secure channel or by quantum teleportation. Its security proof relies on the no-cloning theorem of quantum theory and the no-superluminal-signalling principle of special relativity.},

Three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain calculations show over 7 times inhibition and 15 times enhancement of the emission rate compared with vacuum for judiciously oriented and positioned dipoles. Emission rate modifications inside the membrane mimic the local mode density in a simple 2D model. The inhibition of emission saturates with crystal size around the source, with a 1/e size that scales as the inverse gap bandwidth. Owing to the vertically guided mode structure, inhibition occurs only near the slab center, but enhanced emission persists also outside the membrane. We find that emission changes can even be observed in experiments with ensembles of randomly oriented dipoles.},

  abstract  = {This paper starts with a brief review of the topic of strong and weak pre- and post-selected (PPS) quantum measurements, as well as weak values, and afterwards presents original work. In particular, we develop a nonperturbative theory of weak \{PPS\} measurements of an arbitrary system with an arbitrary meter, for arbitrary initial states of the system and the meter. New and simple analytical formulas are obtained for the average and the distribution of the meter pointer variable. These formulas hold to all orders in the weak value. In the case of a mixed preselected state, in addition to the standard weak value, an associated weak value is required to describe weak \{PPS\} measurements. In the linear regime, the theory provides the generalized Aharonov–Albert–Vaidman formula. Moreover, we reveal two new regimes of weak \{PPS\} measurements: the strongly-nonlinear regime and the inverted region (the regime with a very large weak value), where the system-dependent contribution to the pointer deflection decreases with increasing the measurement strength. The optimal conditions for weak \{PPS\} measurements are obtained in the strongly-nonlinear regime, where the magnitude of the average pointer deflection is equal or close to the maximum. This maximum is independent of the measurement strength, being typically of the order of the pointer uncertainty. In the optimal regime, the small parameter of the theory is comparable to the overlap of the pre- and post-selected states. We show that the amplification coefficient in the weak \{PPS\} measurements is generally a product of two qualitatively different factors. The effects of the free system and meter Hamiltonians are discussed. We also estimate the size of the ensemble required for a measurement and identify optimal and efficient meters for weak measurements. Exact solutions are obtained for a certain class of the measured observables. These solutions are used for numerical calculations, the results of which agree with the theory. Moreover, the theory is extended to allow for a completely general post-selection measurement. We also discuss time-symmetry properties of \{PPS\} measurements of any strength and the relation between \{PPS\} and standard (not post-selected) measurements.},

In order to obtain the desired performance, the middle portions of two multimode plastic clad silica fibers are unclad and are used as the sensing elements in the two arms of the sensor. Each of the sensor arms is sourced by separate super bright green LEDs, which are modulated in a time-sharing manner and a single photo detector is employed for detecting these light signals. The performance and characteristics of this system clearly establish the usefulness of the technique for detecting very low concentrations of the dissolved contaminants.},

Here, we use an optical nanofiber embedded in a cloud of laser-cooled Rb87 for near-infrared frequency up-conversion via a resonant two-photon process. Sub-nW powers of the two-photon radiation, at 780 and 776 nm, copropagate through the optical nanofiber and the generation of 420 nm photons is observed. A measurement of the Autler-Townes splitting provides a direct measurement of the Rabi frequency of the 780 nm transition. Through this method, dephasings of the system can be studied. In this work, the optical nanofiber is used as an excitation and detection tool simultaneously, and it highlights some of the advantages of using fully fibered systems for nonlinear optics with atoms.},

  abstract  = {Optical nanofibres are used to confine light to sub-wavelength regions and are very promising tools for the development of optical fibre-based quantum networks using cold, neutral atoms. To date, experimental studies on atoms near nanofibres have focussed on fundamental fibre mode interactions. In this work, we demonstrate the integration of a few-mode optical nanofibre into a magneto-optical trap for 87Rb atoms. The nanofibre, with a waist diameter of 700 nm, supports both the fundamental and first group of higher order modes (HOMs) and is used for atomic fluorescence and absorption studies. In general, light propagating in higher order fibre modes has a greater evanescent field extension around the waist in comparison with the fundamental mode. By exploiting this behaviour, we demonstrate that the detected signal of fluorescent photons emitted from a cloud of cold atoms centred at the nanofibre waist is larger if HOMs are also included. In particular, the signal from HOMs appears to be about six times larger than that obtained for the fundamental mode. Absorption of on-resonance, HOM probe light by the laser-cooled atoms is also observed. These advances should facilitate the realization of atom trapping schemes based on HOM interference.},

  abstract  = {Optical nanofibres are ultrathin optical fibres with a waist diameter typically less than the wavelength of light being guided through them. Cold atoms can couple to the evanescent field of the nanofibre-guided modes and such systems are emerging as promising technologies for the development of atom-photon hybrid quantum devices. Atoms within the evanescent field region of an optical nanofibre can be probed by sending near or on-resonant light through the fibre; however, the probe light can detrimentally affect the properties of the atoms. In this paper, we report on the modification of the local temperature of laser-cooled 87 Rb atoms in a magneto-optical trap centred around an optical nanofibre when near-resonant probe light propagates through it. A transient absorption technique has been used to measure the temperature of the affected atoms and temperature variations from 160 μ k to 850 μ k, for a probe power ranging from 0 to 50 nW, have been observed. This effect could have implications in relation to using optical nanofibres for probing and manipulating cold or ultracold atoms.},

The topological structures in the polarization ellipse orientation field, the Stokes field, and the Poynting vector field are derived from the same vector-vortex beam fields, and their interdependencies are explored using a designed experimental setup. We find that the inherently stable topological approach is much more informative for a deeper understanding of complex vector-vortex beam fields.},

The progress in quantum optics indicates that this feature does not suffice to witness exotic behavior of light. Contrary, quantum non-Gaussianity is starting to appear as a promising and applicable property reflecting interesting states of light that are suitable for quantum protocols. We investigate a newly introduced hierarchy of criteria of quantum non-Gaussianity and predict this attribute can be observed on light emitted from many single photon emitters, even if the light undergoes realistic optical losses. It contrasts negativity of Wigner function, that is unreachable in experimental platforms with losses above fifty percent.},

  abstract  = {We review the theory of the Casimir effect using scattering techniques. After years of theoretical effort, this formalism is now largely mastered so that the accuracy of theory-experiment comparisons is determined by the level of precision and pertinence of the description of experimental conditions. Due to an imperfect knowledge of the optical properties of real mirrors used in the experiment, the effect of imperfect reflection remains a source of uncertainty in theory-experiment comparisons. For the same reason, the temperature dependence of the Casimir force between dissipative mirrors remains a matter of debate. We also emphasize that real mirrors do not obey exactly the assumption of specular reflection, which is used in nearly all calculations of material and temperature corrections. This difficulty may be solved by using a more general scattering formalism accounting for non-specular reflection with wavevectors and field polarizations mixed. This general formalism has already been fruitfully used for evaluating the effect of roughness on the Casimir force as well as the lateral Casimir force appearing between corrugated surfaces. The commonly used 'proximity force approximation (PFA)' turns out to lead to inaccuracies in the description of these two effects.},

We derive the coupled-mode propagation equation, the input-output equation, the scattering matrix, the transfer matrix, and the reflection and transmission coefficients for the guided field in the linear, quasistationary, weak-excitation regime. We show that, when the initial distribution of populations of atomic ground-state sublevels is independent of the magnetic quantum number, the quasilinear polarizations along the principal axes x and y, which are parallel and perpendicular, respectively, to the radial direction of the atomic position, are not coupled to each other in the linear coherent scattering process. When the guided probe field is quasilinearly polarized along the major principal axis x, forward and backward scattering have different characteristics. We find that, when the array period is far from the Bragg resonance, the backward scattering is weak. Under the Bragg resonance, most of the guided probe light can be reflected back in a broad region of field detunings even though there is an irreversible decay channel into radiation modes. When the atom number is large enough, two different band gaps may be formed, whose properties depend on the polarization of the guided probe field.},

  abstract  = {We study the propagation of guided light along an array of three-level atoms in the vicinity of an optical nanofiber under the condition of electromagnetically induced transparency. We examine two schemes of atomic levels and field polarizations where the guided probe field is quasilinearly polarized along the major or minor principal axis, which is parallel or perpendicular, respectively, to the radial direction of the atomic position. Our numerical calculations indicate that 200 cesium atoms in a linear array with a length of 100 μm at a distance of 200 nm from the surface of a nanofiber with a radius of 250 nm can slow down the speed of guided probe light by a factor of about 3.5 × 106 (the corresponding group delay is about 1.17 μs). In the neighborhood of the Bragg resonance, a significant fraction of the guided probe light can be reflected back with a negative group delay. The reflectivity and the group delay of the reflected field do not depend on the propagation direction of the probe field. However, when the input guided light is quasilinearly polarized along the major principal axis, the transmittivity and the group delay of the transmitted field substantially depend on the propagation direction of the probe field. Under the Bragg resonance condition, an array of atoms prepared in an appropriate internal state can transmit guided light polarized along the major principal in one specific direction even in the limit of infinitely large atom numbers. The directionality of transmission of guided light through the array of atoms is a consequence of the existence of a longitudinal component of the guided light field as well as the ellipticity of both the field polarization and the atomic dipole vector.},

  abstract  = {An integrated optical dipole trap uses two-color (red and blue-detuned) traveling evanescent wave fields for trapping cold neutral atoms. To achieve longitudinal confinement, we propose using an integrated optical waveguide coupler, which provides a potential gradient along the beam propagation direction sufficient to confine atoms. This integrated optical dipole trap can support an atomic ensemble with a large optical depth due to its small mode area. Its quasi- TE 0 waveguide mode has an advantage over the HE 11 mode of a nanofiber, with little inhomogeneous Zeeman broadening at the trapping region. The longitudinal confinement eliminates the need for a one dimensional optical lattice, reducing collisional blockaded atomic loading, potentially producing larger ensembles. The waveguide trap allows for scalability and integrability with nano-fabrication technology. We analyze the potential performance of such integrated atom traps.},

  abstract  = {Abstract The scattering characteristics of an infinite cylinder are strongly influenced by the incidence angle relative to its axis. If the incident wave propagates in the plane normal to the axis of the cylinder, the polarization of the scattered wave remains unchanged and the scattered wave propagates in the same plan as the incident wave. At off-axis incidence such that the incident direction makes an oblique angle with the cylinder axis, the scattered wave is depolarized, and its spatial distribution becomes three-dimensional. This paper presents the scattering solution for oblique incidence on multiple parallel cylinders located near a planar interface by an evanescent wave that is generated by total internal reflection of the source wave propagating in the higher refractive index substrate. Hertz potentials are utilized to formulate the interaction of inhomogeneous waves with the cylinders, scattering at the substrate interface, and near field scattering between the cylinders. Analytic formulas are derived for the electromagnetic fields and Poynting vector of scattered radiation in the near-field and their asymptotic forms in the far-field. Numerical examples are shown to illustrate scattering of evanescent wave by multiple cylinders at off-axis incidence.},

We show that the dynamics of this system can be described by a Bose–Hubbard Hamiltonian with attractive interactions for polaritons, superpositions of photons and qubit excitations. This setup, we envisage, is one of the first platforms where all the technological components that are needed to experimentally study chains of strongly interacting polaritons have already been realized. By driving the first stripline resonator with a microwave source and detecting the output field of the last stripline resonator, one can spectroscopically probe the properties of the system in the driven dissipative regime. We calculate the stationary polariton density and density–density correlations g (2) for the last cavity, which can be measured via the output field. Our results display a transition from a coherent to a quantum field as the ratio of on-site interactions to driving strength is increased.},

Verifying high-order entanglement without the restriction of system complexity is a critical need in any experiments on general entanglement. Here, we introduce a scheme to efficiently detect genuine high-order entanglement, such as states close to genuine qudit Bell, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger, and cluster states as well as multilevel multi-DOF hyperentanglement. All of them can be identified with two local measurement settings per DOF regardless of the qudit or DOF number. The proposed verifications together with further utilities such as fidelity estimation could pave the way for experiments by reducing dramatically the measurement overhead.},

  abstract  = {Using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method, we investigated the optical properties of a periodic array of strongly coupled gold nanoparticles (MNPs). We show the two kinds properties of transmission spectra with both different interparticle spaces and different radii of the particles. It is found that some distinct extra resonant peaks appear in the forbidden band gap and the resonant frequency depends strongly on the space between the particles and the radius of the particles. Based on the localized nature of the field distribution, we also show clearly the presence of local plasmons resonant modes that originate from quadrupole plasmon polaritons.},

Based on this distribution function, a model is developed for luminescence from localized-state ensemble with a Gaussian-type density of states. The model reproduces quantitatively all the anomalous temperature behaviors of localized-state luminescence. It reduces to the well-known band-tail and luminescence quenching models under certain approximations.},

The pulse control of the biexciton dynamics, combined with previouslydemonstrated control of the single-exciton Rabi rotation, serves as the physical basis for a two-bit conditional quantum logic gate. The truth table of the gate shows the features of an all-optical quantum gate with interacting yet distinguishable excitons as qubits. Evaluation of the fidelity yields a value of 0.7 for the gate operation. Such experimental capabilityis essential to a scheme for scalable quantum computation bymeans of the optical control of spin qubits in dots.},

We also calculate the optimal experimental parameters for these two laser wavelengths for laser power per beam ranging from 5 W to 100 W. We further experimentally studied the loading of laser-cooled Rb87 atoms into a small-angle crossed Nd:YAG ODT and found that the experimental data agreed with the simulation results.},

We show that spin squeezing can be enhanced greatly under three different decoherence channels and spin-squeezing sudden death can be avoided undergoing amplitude-damping and phase-damping channels. Moreover, we find that the spin-squeezing parameters can be completely recovered to its initial value under amplitude-damping channel by changing weak measurement strength irrespective of sufficiently strong decoherence. For the phase-damping channel, the spin-squeezing parameter can be recovered to a certain stationary value in certain conditions. Our results provide an active way to suppress decoherence and enhance the spin squeezing under decoherence, which is rather significant for quantum metrology in open systems.},

Based on this nano-manipulation technique, we experimentally demonstrate the evanescent coupling of single fluorescence photons emitted by a single NV-center to the guided mode of the TOF. By comparing photon count rates of the fiber-guided and the free-space modes and with the help of numerical finite-difference time domain simulations, we determine a lower and upper bound for the coupling efficiency of (9.5 ± 0.6)% and (10.4 ± 0.7)%, respectively. Our results are a promising starting point for future integration of single photon sources into photonic quantum networks and applications in quantum information science.},

The excitation of the LC resonance in the normal-incidence geometry used in our experiments occurs through the coupling of the electric field of the incident light to the capacitance. The measured optical spectra of the nanofabricated gold structures come very close to the theoretical expectations. Additional numerical simulations show that our structures exhibit a frequency range with negative permeability for a beam configuration in which the magnetic field couples to the LC resonance. Together with an electric response that has negative permittivity, this can lead to materials with a negative index of refraction.},

  abstract  = {Superconducting photon detectors have emerged as a powerful new option for detecting single photons. System detection efficiency that incorporates the quantum efficiency of the device and system losses is one of the most important single-photon detector performance metrics for quantum information applications. Superconducting transition-edge sensors (TESs) are microcalorimeters that have the ability of distinguishing single photons with negligible dark counts. In addition, TESs are capable of directly measuring the photon number in a pulse of light. We have achieved near-unity system detection efficiency with TESs at particular wavelengths in the near-infrared by using multilayer structures that enhance the absorption of light into the active device material. We describe the design of the multilayer structure enabling high detection efficiency TESs including issues and requirements for obtaining detection efficiency values higher than 99 %. We describe the device fabrication and finally, show recent results of devices optimized for high detection efficiency using the multilayer structure.},

  abstract  = {We review the progress and main challenges in implementing large-scale quantum computing by optical control of electron spins in quantum dots (QDs). Relevant systems include self-assembled QDs of III–V or II–VI compound semiconductors (such as InGaAs and CdSe), monolayer fluctuation QDs in compound semiconductor quantum wells, and impurity centres in solids, such as P-donors in silicon and nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond. The decoherence of the electron spin qubits is discussed and various schemes for countering the decoherence problem are reviewed. We put forward designs of local nodes consisting of a few qubits which can be individually addressed and controlled. Remotely separated local nodes are connected by photonic structures (microcavities and waveguides) to form a large-scale distributed quantum system or a quantum network. The operation of the quantum network consists of optical control of a single electron spin, coupling of two spins in a local nodes, optically controlled quantum interfacing between stationary spin qubits in QDs and flying photon qubits in waveguides, rapid initialization of spin qubits and qubit-specific single-shot non-demolition quantum measurement. The rapid qubit initialization may be realized by selectively enhancing certain entropy dumping channels via phonon or photon baths. The single-shot quantum measurement may be in situ implemented through the integrated photonic network. The relevance of quantum non-demolition measurement to large-scale quantum computation is discussed. To illustrate the feasibility and demand, the resources are estimated for the benchmark problem of factorizing 15 with Shor's algorithm.},

  abstract  = {Machine-learning tasks frequently involve problems of manipulating and classifying large numbers of vectors in high-dimensional spaces. Classical algorithms for solving such problems typically take time polynomial in the number of vectors and the dimension of the space. Quantum computers are good at manipulating high-dimensional vectors in large tensor product spaces. This paper provides supervised and unsupervised quantum machine learning algorithms for cluster assignment and cluster finding. Quantum machine learning can take time logarithmic in both the number of vectors and their dimension, an exponential speed-up over classical algorithms.},

In our analysis, we use the emission from a close-packed free-standing film as a reference. After discounting the angular redistribution effect, our analysis shows that the observed enhancement is larger than the combined effects of Purcell enhancement and dielectric enhancement with the microscopic local field. The additional enhancement mechanisms, which are consistent with all our observations, are thought to be spectral diffusion mediated by phonons and local polarization fluctuations that allow off-resonant excitons to emit at the cavity wavelengths.},

  abstract  = {The theory of the fundamental limits (TFL) of nonlinear optics is a powerful tool for experimentalists seeking to create molecules and materials with large responses and for theorists who are seeking to understand how the basic elements of quantum theory delineate the boundaries within which these searches should be conducted. On a practical level, the TFL provides a metric for measuring the performance or \&\#x201C;goodness\&\#x201D; of new molecules, relative to what is possible. Explorations of large sets of structures within the theory provide insight into new design rules for creating more active molecules. This paper is a review of the TFL, starting with a history of its development and its first use in discovering that all molecules as of the year 2000 fell a factor of 30 below the limits, and continuing to the present day, where the theory continues to provide research opportunities and challenges. The review focuses on off-resonant nonlinear optics in order to sharply focus on the key elements of the TFL, but pointers are provided to the literature for near- and on-resonance applications.},

Two electro-optical modulators act in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer as high-speed phase shifters and rapidly tune its splitting ratio. We test its performance with heralded single photons, observing a polarization-independent interference contrast above 95\&\#x00025;. The switching time is about 5.6 ns, and a maximal repetition rate is 2.5 MHz. We demonstrate tunable feed-forward operations of a single-qubit gate of path-encoded qubits and a two-qubit gate via measurement-induced interaction between two photons.},

  abstract  = {We consider an ensemble of trapped atoms interacting with a continuous-wave laser field. For sufficiently polarized atoms and for a polarized light field, we may approximate the nonclassical components of the collective spin angular momentum operator for the atoms and the Stokes vectors of the field by effective position and momentum variables for which we assume a Gaussian state. Within this approximation, we present a theory for the squeezing of the atomic spin by polarization rotation measurements on the probe light. We derive analytical expressions for the squeezing with and without inclusion of the noise effects introduced by atomic decay and by photon absorption. The theory is readily adapted to the case of inhomogeneous light-atom coupling [A. Kuzmich and T.A.B. Kennedy, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 030407 (2004)]. As a special case, we show how to formulate the theory for an optically thick sample by slicing the gas into pieces, each having only small photon absorption probability. Our analysis of a realistic probing and measurement scheme shows that it is the maximally squeezed component of the atomic gas that determines the accuracy of the measurement.},

A pedagogical approach is followed throughout the presentation, where many aspects of localization are illustrated by means of a few simple models. The tutorial starts with some basic aspects of random matrix theory and light propagation through and reflection from a random stack of dielectric slabs. Transverse Anderson localization of light in one- and two-dimensional coupled waveguide arrays is subsequently established and discussed. Recent experimental observations of localization and image transport in disordered optical fibers are discussed. More advanced topics, such as hyper-transport in longitudinally varying disordered waveguides, the impact of nonlinearity, and propagation of partially coherent and quantum light, are also examined.},

Large Purcell factors for slow light modes, and enormous  factors 0.85 over a broadband 10 THz spectral range are subsequently predicted. The local density of photon states is found to diverge at the photonic band edge, but we discuss why this divergence will always be broadened in real samples, most notably due to structural disorder. Applications towards “on-chip'' single photon sources are highlighted.},

The technique exploits a simple hybrid trap consisting of a single beam dipole trap positioned 25 μ m below the field zero of a magnetic quadrupole potential. Transportation is realized by applying a moderate bias field (12 G) to displace the magnetic field zero of the quadrupole potential along the axis of the dipole trap. We use the technique to demonstrate that atomic gases may be controllably transported over 8 mm with negligible heating or loss. The transport path is completely defined by the optical waveguide and we demonstrate that, by aligning the waveguide through a super polished prism, ultracold atoms may be controllably delivered up to a predetermined region of a surface.},

The probe incorporates both single-strand optical fibers and an image guide and allows atomic emission and Raman analysis of any spot on a solid sample within a 5 mm diameter field of view. The real-time sample imaging aspects of the probe are demonstrated by measuring LIBS spectra from different regions of a granite sample and by measuring the Raman spectra of individual TiO2 and Sr(NO3)2 particles on a soil substrate. The ability to obtain remote Raman images of the TiO2 and Sr(NO3)2 particles on the soil substrate is also demonstrated. In this paper we discuss the design and implementation of the fiber-optic probe for obtaining LIBS spectra, Raman spectra, and Raman images.},

Photonics 3 687--95). Colour centres in diamond offer a promising solution, and the narrow linewidth of the recently identified nickel-based NE8 centre makes it particularly appealing for realizing the transform-limited sources necessary for quantum interference. Here, we report the characterization of dipole orientation and coherence properties of a single NE8 colour centre in a diamond nanocrystal at room temperature. We observe a single-photon coherence time of 0.21 ps and an emission lifetime of 1.5 ns. Combined with an emission wavelength that is ideally suited for applications in existing quantum optical systems, these results show that NE8 is a far more promising source than the more commonly studied nitrogen-vacancy centre and point the way to the realization of a practical diamond colour centre-based single-photon source.},

We focus on the relatively low temperature limit where both the spin–spin and spin–orbit effects are important to consider. We demonstrate that group theory may be used to clarify several aspects of the NV structure, such as ordering of the singlets in the ( e 2 ) electronic configuration and the spin–spin and spin–orbit interactions in the ( ae ) electronic configuration. We also discuss how the optical selection rules and the response of the center to electric field can be used for spin–photon entanglement schemes. Our general formalism is applicable to a broad class of local defects in solids. The present results have important implications for applications in quantum information science and nanomagnetometry.},

However, quantum properties of light are completely neglected in all quantum gas experiments. Extending methods of quantum optics to many-body physics will enable phenomena unobtainable in classical optical setups. We show how using the quantum optical feedback creates strong correlations in bosonic and fermionic systems. It balances two competing processes, originating from different fields: quantum backaction of weak optical measurement and many-body dynamics, resulting in stabilized density waves and antiferromagnetic and NOON states. Our approach is extendable to other systems promising for quantum technologies.},

  abstract  = {Quantum-mechanically correlated (entangled) states of many particles are of interest in quantum information, quantum computing and quantum metrology. Metrologically useful entangled states of large atomic ensembles have been experimentally realized, but these states display Gaussian spin distribution functions with a non-negative Wigner quasiprobability distribution function. Non-Gaussian entangled states have been produced in small ensembles of ions, and very recently in large atomic ensembles. Here we generate entanglement in a large atomic ensemble via an interaction with a very weak laser pulse; remarkably, the detection of a single photon prepares several thousand atoms in an entangled state. We reconstruct a negative-valued Wigner function—an important hallmark of non-classicality—and verify an entanglement depth (the minimum number of mutually entangled atoms) of 2,910 ± 190 out of 3,100 atoms. Attaining such a negative Wigner function and the mutual entanglement of virtually all atoms is unprecedented for an ensemble containing more than a few particles. Although the achieved purity of the state is slightly below the threshold for entanglement-induced metrological gain, further technical improvement should allow the generation of states that surpass this threshold, and of more complex Schrödinger cat states for quantum metrology and information processing. More generally, our results demonstrate the power of heralded methods for entanglement generation, and illustrate how the information contained in a single photon can drastically alter the quantum state of a large system.},

  abstract  = {Diffraction restricts the ability of most electromagnetic devices to image or selectively target objects smaller than the wavelength. We describe planar subwavelength structures capable of focusing well beyond the diffraction limit, operating at arbitrary frequencies. The structure design, related to that of Fresnel plates, forces the input field to converge to a spot on the focal plane. However, unlike the diffraction-limited zone plates, for which focusing results from the interference of traveling waves, the subwavelength plates control the near field and, as such, their superlensing properties originate from a static form of interference. Practical implementations of these plates hold promise for near-field data storage, noncontact sensing, imaging, and nanolithography applications.},

  abstract  = {Quantum control of many body atomic spins is often pursued in the context of an atom-light quantum interface, where a quantized light field acts as a "quantum bus" that can be used to entangle distant atoms. One key challenge is to improve the coherence of the atom-light interface and the amount of atom-light entanglement it can generate, given the constraints of working with multilevel atoms and optical fields in a 3D geometry. We have explored new ways to achieve this, through rigorous optimization of the spatial geometry, and through control of the internal atomic state. Our basic setup consists of a quantized probe beam passing through an atom cloud held in a dipole trap, first generating spin-probe entanglement through the Faraday interaction, and then using backaction from a measurement of the probe polarization to squeeze the collective atomic spin. The relevant figure of merit is the metrologically useful spin squeezing determined by the enhancement in the resolution of rotations of the collective spin, relative to the commonly used spin coherent state. With an optimized free-space geometry, and by using a 2-color probe scheme to suppress tensor light shifts, we achieve 3(2) dB of metrologically useful spin squeezing. We can further increase atom-light coupling by implementing internal state control to prepare spin states with larger initial projection noise relative to the spin coherent state. Under the right conditions this increase in projection noise can lead to stronger measurement backaction and increased atom-atom entanglement. With further internal state control the increased atom-atom entanglement can then be mapped to a basis where it corresponds to improved squeezing of, e.g., the physical spin-angular momentum or the collective atomic clock pseudospin. In practice, controlling the collective spin of N ~ 106 atoms in this fashion is an extraordinarily difficult challenge because errors in the control of individual atoms tend to be highly correlated. By employing precise internal state control, we have prepared and detected projection noise limited "cat" states (which have initial projection noise that is larger by a factor of 2f = 8 for Cs relative to the spin coherent state) and estimate that we can generate up to 6.0(5) dB of metrologically useful spin squeezing, demonstrating the advantage of using the internal atomic structure as a resource for ensemble control.},

  abstract  = {Optical two-dimensional Fourier transform spectroscopy (2DFTS) is used to measure thermal broadening of the ground state exciton homogeneous linewidth and energy relaxation in a single layer of interfacial GaAs quantum dots (QDs). We observe a nonlinear increase in the homogeneous linewidth with temperature from 6 to 50 K and find that a phonon activation term offset fit the data well. The absence of an activation peak in the 2D spectra indicates that elastic exciton–phonon scattering via virtual transitions between the ground and excited states significantly contributes to the thermal broadening. Measurements of the linewidth across the inhomogeneous distribution show that excitons localized in smaller QDs experience stronger thermal broadening. We record 2D spectra for a population time up to 500 ps and temperature up to 50 K to reveal excitonic relaxation from quantum well to QD states. As the temperature increases from 6 to 50 K, the relaxation time decreases from 180 to 30 ps, respectively. This behavior is consistent with a phonon-mediated scattering process.},

  abstract  = {Investigations of slow and fast light effects in semiconductor waveguides entail interesting physics and point to a number of promising applications. In this review we give an overview of recent progress in the field, in particular focusing on the physical mechanisms of electromagnetically induced transparency and coherent population oscillations. While electromagnetically induced transparency has been the most important effect in realizing slowdown effects in atomic gasses, progress has been comparatively slow in semiconductors due to inherent problems of fast dephasing times and inhomogeneous broadening in quantum dots. The physics of electromagnetically induced transparency in semiconductors is discussed, emphasizing these limitations and recent suggestions for overcoming them. On the other hand, the mechanism of coherent population oscillations relies on wave mixing effects and is well suited for semiconductor waveguides. Recent experimental progress is reviewed, emphasizing new ideas that have significantly enhanced the degree of control that can be exercised and the frequency range that can be achieved. Thus, applications within microwave photonics appear to be within reach.},

  abstract  = {A comparative study of the signal acquisition from straight fiber and tapered optical fibers has been analyzed theoretically for the design of an evanescent wave fiber optic immunosensor. It has been shown that tapered optical fibers have higher sensitivity compared to straight fibers. Among the tapered fibers combination tapered fibers were also found to have higher sensitivity than continuous tapered fibers. Theoretical analysis indicates that an increase in signal is a result of three factors, namely, V number matching, an increase in evanescent absorption by the fluorescent medium, and an increase in fluorescence emission coupling into the fiber. Maximum sensitivity is obtained when the radius of the fiber is reduced to the V number matching radius within 1 cm from the start of the taper with rest of the fiber remaining untapered. Also, a higher signal level is obtained when the launching light fills the numerical aperture determined by the tapering ratio of the fiber. © 1998 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.},

  abstract  = {We propose a scheme involving cold atoms trapped in optical lattices to observe different phenomena traditionally linked to quantum-optical systems. The basic idea consists of connecting the trapped atomic state to a non-trapped state through a Raman scheme. The coupling between these two types of atoms (trapped and free) turns out to be similar to that describing light–matter interaction within the rotating-wave approximation, the role of matter and photons being played by the trapped and free atoms, respectively. We explain in particular how to observe phenomena arising from the collective spontaneous emission of atomic and harmonic oscillator samples, such as superradiance and directional emission. We also show how the same setup can simulate Bose–Hubbard Hamiltonians with extended hopping as well as Ising models with long-range interactions. We believe that this system can be realized with state of the art technology.},

The observed excitation spectra of such near-surface atoms reveal drastic difference from free-space atom and show signatures of atom-surface bound states. We experimentally demonstrate that the spectrum lineshape and hence the loading into such surface bound states can be controlled by changing the surface conditions. The measured emission spectra, under the controlled surface conditions, further clarify the behavior of free- and bound-atoms. We discuss the possible roles of adsorption and desorption of atoms in controlling the surface conditions.},

In the standard model of a quantum computer, a computation consists of a sequence of unitary gates acting coherently on the qubits making up the computer. This requirement for coherent unitary dynamical operations is widely believed to be the critical element of quantum computation. Here we show that a very different model involving only projective measurements and quantum memory is also universal for quantum computation. In particular, no coherent unitary dynamics are involved in the computation.},

  abstract  = {This article is a short introduction to and review of the cluster-state model of quantum computation, in which coherent quantum information processing is accomplished via a sequence of single-qubit measurements applied to a fixed quantum state known as a cluster state. We also discuss a few novel properties of the model, including a proof that the cluster state cannot occur as the exact ground state of any naturally occurring physical system, and a proof that measurements on any quantum state which is linearly prepared in one dimension can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer, and thus are not candidates for use as a substrate for quantum computation.},

  abstract  = {In circuit quantum electrodynamics(QED), where superconducting artificial atoms are coupled to on-chip cavities, the exploration of fundamental quantum physics in the strong-coupling regime has greatly evolved. In this regime, an atom and a cavity can exchange a photon frequently before coherence is lost. Nevertheless, all experiments so far are well described by the renowned Jaynes–Cummings model. Here, we report on the first experimental realization of a circuit QED system operating in the ultrastrong-coupling limit, where the atom–cavity coupling rate g reaches a considerable fraction of the cavity transition frequency ωr. Furthermore, we present direct evidence for the breakdown of the Jaynes–Cummings model. We reach remarkable normalized coupling rates g/ωr of up to 12% by enhancing the inductive coupling14 of a flux qubit to a transmission line resonator. Our circuit extends the toolbox of quantum optics on a chip towards exciting explorations of ultrastrong light–matter interaction.},

  abstract  = {Abstract We construct the manifold describing the family of plane monochromatic light waves with all directions, polarizations, phases and intensities. A smooth description of polarization, valid over the entire sphere S 2 of directions, is given through the construction of an orthogonal basis pair of complex polarization vectors for each direction; any light beam is then uniquely and smoothly specified by giving its direction and two complex amplitudes. This implies that the space of all light beams is the six dimensional manifold S 2 × C 2 { 0 } , the (untwisted) Cartesian product of a sphere and a two dimensional complex vector space minus the origin. A Hopf map (i.e. mapping the two complex amplitudes to the Stokes parameters) then leads to the four dimensional manifold S 2 × S 2 which describes beams with all directions and polarization states. This product of two spheres can be viewed as an ordered pair of two points on a single sphere, in contrast to earlier work in which the same system was represented using Majorana’s mapping of the states of a spin one quantum system to an unordered pair of points on a sphere. This is a different manifold, C P 2 , two dimensional complex projective space, which does not faithfully represent the full space of all directions and polarizations. Following the now-standard framework, we exhibit the fibre bundle whose total space is the set of all light beams of non-zero intensity, and base space S 2 × S 2 . We give the U ( 1 ) connection which determines the geometric phase as the line integral of a one-form along a closed curve in the total space. Bases are classified as globally smooth, global but singular, and local, with the last type of basis being defined only when the curve traversed by the system is given. Existing as well as new formulae for the geometric phase are presented in this overall framework.},

Preparing the atoms in a state with large quantum fluctuations in magnetization strengthens the entangling Faraday interaction. The resulting increase in interatomic entanglement can be converted into metrologically useful spin squeezing. Further control can squeeze the internal atomic spin without compromising entanglement, providing an overall multiplicative factor in the collective squeezing.

  abstract  = {Recently, strongly modulated photonic crystals, fabricated by the state-of-the-art semiconductor nanofabrication process, have realized various novel optical properties. This paper describes the way in which they differ from other optical media, and clarifies what they can do. In particular, three important issues are considered: light confinement, frequency dispersion and spatial dispersion. First, I describe the latest status and impact of ultra-strong light confinement in a wavelength-cubic volume achieved in photonic crystals. Second, the extreme reduction in the speed of light is reported, which was achieved as a result of frequency dispersion management. Third, strange negative refraction in photonic crystals is introduced, which results from their unique spatial dispersion, and it is clarified how this leads to perfect imaging . The last two sections are devoted to applications of these novel properties. First, I report the fact that strong light confinement and huge light–matter interaction enhancement make strongly modulated photonic crystals promising for on-chip all-optical processing, and present several examples including all-optical switches/memories and optical logics. As a second application, it is shown that the strong light confinement and slow light in strongly modulated photonic crystals enable the adiabatic tuning of light, which leads to various novel ways of controlling light, such as adiabatic frequency conversion, efficient optomechanics systems, photon memories and photons pinning.},

  abstract  = {We consider the directed superradiant emission from a collection of N two-state atoms with arbitrary spatial locations within the framework of quantum trajectory theory and without a single-mode assumption. The formalism is developed around an unravelling of the master equation in terms of source mode quantum jumps. A modified boson approximation is made to treat the many-atom case, where it is found that strong directional superradiance occurs for a few thousand atoms, even with randomized atomic positions.},

  abstract  = {Quantum information science addresses how uniquely quantum mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement can enhance communication, information processing, and precision measurement. Photons are appealing for their low-noise, light-speed transmission and ease of manipulation using conventional optical components. However, the lack of highly efficient optical Kerr nonlinearities at the single photon level was a major obstacle. In a breakthrough, Knill, Laflamme, and Milburn (KLM) showed that such an efficient nonlinearity can be achieved using only linear optical elements, auxiliary photons, and measurement [Knill E, Laflamme R, Milburn GJ (2001) Nature 409:462]. KLM proposed a heralded controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate for scalable quantum computation using a photonic quantum circuit to combine two such nonlinear elements. Here we experimentally demonstrate a KLM CNOT gate. We developed a stable architecture to realize the required four-photon network of nested multiple interferometers based on a displaced-Sagnac interferometer and several partially polarizing beamsplitters. This result confirms the first step in the original KLM "recipe" for all-optical quantum computation, and should be useful for on-demand entanglement generation and purification. Optical quantum circuits combining giant optical nonlinearities may find wide applications in quantum information processing, communication, and sensing.},

Four QD ensembles and strain reducing layers (SRLs) were grown in selective areas on a wafer by the use of a 90° rotational metal mask. The SRL thickness was varied to achieve appropriate shifts in the peak wavelength of the QD emission spectrum of up to 120 nm. The four-color QD ensembles were expected to have a broad bandwidth of more than 160 nm due to the combination of excited state emissions when introduced in a current-induced broadband light source such as a superluminescent diode (SLD). Furthermore, a desired shape of the SLD spectrum can be obtained by controlling the injection current applied to each QD ensemble. The broadband and spectrum shape controlled light source is promising for high-resolution and low-noise OCT systems.},

The key element of our experiment is a whispering-gallery-mode bottle microresonator, which is coupled to a single atom and interfaced by two tapered fiber couplers. This system reaches the strong coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics, leading to a vacuum Rabi splitting in the excitation spectrum. We systematically investigate the switching efficiency of our system, i.e., the probability that the fiber-optical switch redirects the light into the desired output. We obtain a large redirection efficiency reaching a raw fidelity of more than 60\% without postselection. Moreover, by measuring the second-order correlation functions of the output fields, we show that our switch exhibits a photon-number-dependent routing capability.},

Here we design in principle and experimentally generate a new kind of uniformly elliptically polarized vector field, which has the same ellipticity and sense of local elliptic polarization at any location and also has a flexibly designable distribution of orientation of the elliptic polarization. An introduced additional degree of freedom is used to flexibly change the ellipticity. In particular, the ellipticity and the orientation of polarization can be independently controlled by two parameters. This makes it easier to both control the spatial structure of the polarization and to engineer the focusing field.},

The fiber amplifier was fabricated by coating PbS QDs doped sol-gel films onto the tapered SMF coupler. Through the evanescent wave, the PbS quantum dots were excited. With a 980 nm wavelength laser diode (LD) as the pump, the fiber amplifier exhibited a wide band optical gain at 1310 nm with the largest gain as high as 10 dB. The amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise is very low resulted from the amplifier configuration of evanescent wave exciting, which is critical to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Therefore the proposed fiber amplifier will find great potential in the fiber-optic communication systems.},

Counter propagating red-detuned HE21 modes are combined with a blue-detuned HE11 fundamental mode to form a potential in the shape of four intertwined spirals. By changing the polarization from circular to linear in each of the two counter-propagating HE21 modes simultaneously the 4-helix configuration can be transformed into a lattice configuration. The modification to the 4-helix configuration due to unwanted excitation of the the TE01 and TM01 modes is also discussed.},

During this process the flying qubit is coherently polarized, emerging in the direction of the majority static spins. We conjecture that this process is reversible for any number of flying qubits injected sequentially in an arbitrary superposition state, proving this explicitly for an arbitrary state of one and two flying qubits. We also find a special case in which we are able to prove the conjecture for an arbitrary number of qubits. Our architecture thus has the potential to be exploited as a passive quantum memory to encode the flying qubits without the necessity of resetting between successive encoding operations. We also illustrate that the quantum information may be spread over many static spins in the memory chain, making the mechanism resistant to spin decoherence and other imperfections. We discuss implementing the memory system with trapped bosonic atoms, controlled by a spatial light modulator.},

This ultralow-power nonlinearity is enabled by a small optical mode area propagating over a relatively long distance through the Xe gas. The use of inert noble gases in these kinds of TOF experiments may offer practical advantages over the use of reactive alkali-metal vapors, such as rubidium.},

  abstract  = {Planar squeezed states, i.e. quantum states which are squeezed in two orthogonal spin components, have recently attracted attention due to their applications in atomic interferometry and quantum information (He et al 2012 New J. Phys. 14 093012). While canonical variables such as quadratures of the radiation field can be squeezed in at most one component, simultaneous squeezing in two orthogonal spin components can be achieved due to the angular momentum commutation relations. We present a novel scheme for planar squeezing via quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements in spin-1 systems. The QND measurement is achieved via near-resonant paramagnetic Faraday rotation probing, and the planar squeezing is obtained by sequential QND measurement of two orthogonal spin components. We compute the achievable squeezing for a variety of optical depths, initial conditions and probing strategies. The planar squeezed states generated in this way contain entanglement detectable by spin-squeezing inequalities and give an advantage relative to non-squeezed states for any precession phase angle, a benefit for single-shot and high-bandwidth magnetometry.},

  abstract  = {This work is a theoretical investigation on the spin-polariton (polarized single photon) entanglement in nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond in order to interpret the results of two landmark experiments reported by the teams of Buckley and Togan in Science and Nature. A Jaynes-Cummings model is applied to analyze the off- and on-resonant dynamics of the electronic spin and polarized photon system. Combined with the analysis on the NV center's electron structure and transition rules, this model consistently explained the Faraday effect, Optical Stark effect, pulse echo technology and energy level engineering technology in the way to realize the spin-polariton entanglement in diamond. All theoretical results are consistent well with the reported phenomena and data. This essay essentially aims at applying the fundamental skills the author has learned in Quantum Optics and Nonlinear Optics, especially to the interesting materials not covered in class, in assignments and examinations, such as calculation on matrix form of Hamiltonian, quantum optical dynamics with dressed state analysis, entanglement and so on.},

  abstract  = {This thesis presents a theoretical study of the collective effects of a large number of photon emitters coupled to optical cavities. The ensemble effects are accounted for by considering both the light emitting and scattering by the photon emitters. It suggests that, to correctly estimate the emitters ensemble coupled cavity mode, it is necessary to consider the existence of the excited excitons ensemble and optical pumps. This thesis shows that optical pumps can excite more excitons and scattering channels as pumping power increases. The change in exciton population can lead to comprehensive spectral behaviors by changing the cavity spectral shapes, bandwidth and resonance positions, through the inhomogeneous broadening and frequencies repulsion effects of collective emissions. The existence of the exciton ensemble can also enhance optical coupling effects between target excitons and the cavity mode. The target exciton, which has a relatively large coupling strength and is close to the cavity peak, can affect the properties of the background dipoles and their coupling to the cavity. All these collective effects are sensitive to the number, the resonances distribution, and the optical properties of the background excitons in the frequency domain and the property of the target exciton, if any. This study provides a perspective on the control of the optical properties of cavities and individual excitons through collective excitation.},

  abstract  = {We study the strong coupling between photons and atoms that can be achieved in an optical nanofiber geometry when the interaction is dispersive. While the Purcell enhancement factor for spontaneous emission into the guided mode does not reach the strong-coupling regime for individual atoms, one can obtain high cooperativity for ensembles of a few thousand atoms due to the tight confinement of the guided modes and constructive interference over the entire chain of trapped atoms. We calculate the dyadic Green's function, which determines the scattering of light by atoms in the presence of the fiber, and thus the phase shift and polarization rotation induced on the guided light by the trapped atoms. The Green's function is related to a full Heisenberg-Langevin treatment of the dispersive response of the quantized field to tensor polarizable atoms. We apply our formalism to quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of the atoms via polarimetry. We study shot-noise-limited detection of atom number for atoms in a completely mixed spin state and the squeezing of projection noise for atoms in clock states. Compared with squeezing of atomic ensembles in free space, we capitalize on unique features that arise in the nanofiber geometry including anisotropy of both the intensity and polarization of the guided modes. We use a first-principles stochastic master equation to model the squeezing as a function of time in the presence of decoherence due to optical pumping. We find a peak metrological squeezing of �~5 dB is achievable with current technology for ~2500 atoms trapped 180 nm from the surface of a nanofiber with radius a=225 nm.},

  abstract  = {Phononic crystals are the acoustic wave analogue of photonic crystals. Here a periodic array of scattering inclusions located in a homogeneous host material forbids certain ranges of acoustic frequencies from existence within the crystal, thus creating what are known as acoustic bandgaps. The majority of previously reported phononic crystal devices have been constructed by hand, assembling scattering inclusions in a viscoelastic medium, predominantly air, water or epoxy, resulting in large structures limited to frequencies below 1 MHz. Recently, phononic crystals and devices have been scaled to VHF (30-300 MHz) frequencies and beyond by utilizing microfabrication and micromachining technologies. This paper reviews recent developments in the area of micro-phononic crystals including design techniques, material considerations, microfabrication processes, characterization methods and reported device structures. Micro-phononic crystal devices realized in low-loss solid materials are emphasized along with their potential application in radio frequency communications and acoustic imaging for medical ultrasound and nondestructive testing. The reported advances in batch micro-phononic crystal fabrication and simplified testing promise not only the deployment of phononic crystals in a number of commercial applications but also greater experimentation on a wide variety of phononic crystal structures.},

The local-field correction leads to a new formulation of the discrete dipole approximation that is exact in the long-wavelength limit and more accurate at finite frequencies. We also discuss the feasibility of a generalization of the local-field correction to arbitrary scatterers.},

  abstract  = {After they have interacted, quantum particles generally behave as a single nonseparable entangled system. The concept of entanglement plays an essential role in quantum physics. We have performed entanglement experiments with Rydberg atoms and microwave photons in a cavity and tested quantum mechanics in situations of increasing complexity. Entanglement resulted either from a resonant exchange of energy between atoms and the cavity field or from dispersive energy shifts affecting atoms and photons when they were not resonant. With two entangled particles (two atoms or one atom and a photon), we have realized new versions of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen situation. The detection of one particle projected the other, at a distance, in a correlated state. This process could be viewed as an elementary measurement, one particle being a “meter'' measuring the other. We have performed a “quantum nondemolition'' measurement of a single photon, which we detected repeatedly without destroying it. Entanglement is also essential to understand decoherence, the process accounting for the classical appearance of the macroscopic world. A mesoscopic superposition of states ("Schrödinger cat") gets rapidly entangled with its environment, losing its quantum coherence. We have prepared a Schrödinger cat made of a few photons and studied the dynamics of its decoherence, in an experiment which constitutes a glimpse at the quantum/classical boundary. We have also investigated entanglement as a resource for the processing of quantum information. By using quantum two-state systems (qubits) instead of classical bits of information, one can perform logical operations exploiting quantum interferences and taking advantage of the properties of entanglement. Manipulating as qubits atoms and photons in a cavity, we have operated a quantum gate and applied it to the generation of a complex three-particle entangled state. We finally discuss the perspectives opened by these experiments for further fundamental studies.},

We demonstrate a class of optical fibers in which these beams can be generated and propagated over long lengths with unprecedented stability, even in the presence of strong bend perturbations.

This fiber also possesses the intriguingly counterintuitive property of being polarization maintaining despite being strictly cylindrically symmetric, a prospect hitherto considered infeasible with optical fibers.},

In this paper, we explore in detail the ray-optical descriptions of anisotropic film waveguides that consist of three-layered biaxial materials with one of the principal axes of the crystal in each of the three media oriented in the direction of propagation and the other two parallel and perpendicular to the plane of the film. We show that the Burke-Kogelnik-Weber (BKW) ray model provides a complete description of energy flow in such anisotropic structures. Expressions for the ray shift, group velocity, power flow, and stored energy, applicable to both TE and TM modes, are presented.},

The treatment of the alloys is based on the generalized quasichemical approach to disorder and composition effects and a cluster expansion to account for the various configurations. The point defects are modelled by supercells which are multiples of the alloy clusters. The total-energy and electronic-structure calculations are performed within the density functional theory and the local spin density approximation. We study the atomic structure, the energetics and the charge-dependent vacancy states for the different clusters versus cation numbers and for the alloys versuscomposition x .},

In this work, we show that the support vector machine, an optimized linear and non-linear binary classifier, can be implemented on a quantum computer, with exponential speedups in the size of the vectors and the number of training data examples. At the core of the algorithm is a non-sparse matrix simulation technique to efficiently perform a principal component analysis and matrix inversion of the training data kernel matrix. We thus provide an example of a quantum big feature and big data algorithm and pave the way for future developments at the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning.},

The algorithm solves vectorial Maxwell's equations for all field components and uses the nonlinear constitutive relation in matrix form as the equations required to describe the nonlinear system. The stability of the code is discussed and its effectiveness is demonstrated through the simulations of self-phase modulation (SPM) and second-harmonic generation (SHG). The authors also show that the combination of nonlinear effects with PCs can result in a significant improvement in device size and integrability, using the example of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI).},

It suffices to send three circularly polarized light fields through the nanofiber; two counterpropagating and far red-detuned with respect to the atomic transition and the third far blue-detuned. Assuming realistic experimental parameters, the transverse confinement of the resulting potential allows one to reach the one-dimensional regime with cesium atoms for temperatures of several μ K . Moreover, by locally varying the nanofiber diameter, the radius and pitch of the double-helix can be modulated, thereby opening a realm of applications in cold-atom physics.},

Wedemonstrate a lowering of the threshold pump power from a off-resonancevalue of 37 $\mu$W to 18 $\mu$W when an individual quantum dot exciton is on-resonancewith the cavity mode. Photon correlation studies below and abovethe laser threshold confirm the single dot influence. At resonance weobserve antibunching with g(2)(0) $=$ 0.36 at low excitation, which increasesto 1 at about 1.5 times the threshold. In the off-resonant case, g(2)(0) is about1 below and above threshold.},

  abstract  = {Quantum state reconstruction based on weak continuous measurement has the advantage of being fast, accurate and almost non-perturbative. In this work we present a pedagogical review of the protocol proposed by Silberfarb et al (2005 Phys. Rev. Lett. 95 030402), whereby an ensemble of identically prepared systems is collectively probed and controlled in a time-dependent manner so as to create an informationally complete continuous measurement record. The measurement history is then inverted to determine the state at the initial time through a maximum-likelihood estimate. The general formalism is applied to the case of reconstruction of the quantum state encoded in the magnetic sublevels of a large-spin alkali atom, 133 Cs. We detail two different protocols for control. Using magnetic interactions and a quadratic ac Stark shift, we can reconstruct a chosen hyperfine manifold F , e.g. the seven-dimensional F = 3 manifold in the electronic ground state of Cs. We review the procedure as implemented in experiments (Smith et al 2006 Phys. Rev. Lett. 97 180403). We extend the protocol to the more ambitious case of reconstruction of states in the full 16-dimensional electronic ground subspace ( F = 3 F = 4), controlled by microwaves and radio-frequency (RF) magnetic fields. We give detailed derivations of all physical interactions, approximations, numerical methods and fitting procedures, tailored to the realistic experimental setting. For the case of light-shift and magnetic control, reconstruction fidelities of ~0.95 have been achieved, limited primarily by inhomogeneities in the light-shift. For the case of microwave/RF-control we simulate fidelity >0.97, limited primarily by signal-to-noise.},

At low temperatures the responses are sample and stress dependent and can be modelled in terms of the previous understanding of the 3 E excited state fine structure which is strain dependent. At room temperature the responses are largely sample and stress independent, and modelling involves invoking a strain independent excited state with a single zero field spin-level splitting of 1.42 GHz. The change in behaviour is attributed to a temperature dependent averaging process over the components of the excited state orbital doublet. It decouples orbit and spin and at high temperature the spin levels become independent of any orbit splitting. One significant implication of this averaging is that it simplifies the development of room temperature applications.},

We examine the efficiency of the fluorescence coupling and describe the asymmetry of the lineshape caused by the redshifts arising from both the van der Waals and Casimir–Polder interaction of the atoms with the surface of the optical nanofibre. We compare the contributions of the van der Waals and Casimir–Polder redshifts and show that the lineshape of the fluorescence coupled into an optical nanofibre is, basically, influenced by the van der Waals redshift and is characterized by a long tail on the red side of the spectrum. We conclude that a measurement of the lineshape of the coupled fluorescence could be used to characterize the strength of the interaction of atoms with dielectric surfaces and for the detection of atoms using nanofibres.},

We investigate spontaneous-emission enhancement from the monopole and the dipole modes of a hexagonal lattice cavity, considering the effects of the finite emitter linewidth and spectral detuning. Large spontaneous-emission enhancement of \$>$50 is achieved numerically from the high-quality-factor monopole mode when the emitter linewidth is comparable with the resonant-mode linewidth. However, if broad-linewidth material is used and a detuning effect is included, the dipole mode with a low quality factor and a smaller mode volume could be more advantageous for spontaneous-emission enhancement.},

The system consists of a circular cavity that provides a high-Q mode in the form of a whispering gallery mode, whereas an adjacent deformed microcavity plays the role of a waveguide or collimator of the light transmitted from the circular cavity. As a result of this very simple, yet robust, concept we obtain high-Q modes with promising directional emission characteristics. No information about phase space is required, and the proposed scheme can be easily realized in experiments.},

It is explained that a control on atom by electro-magnetic fields helps to design the quantum analog of classical optical systems. In these atom optical systems chaos may appear at the onset of external fields. The classical and quantum chaotic dynamics is discussed, in particular in an atom optics Fermi accelerator. It is found that the quantum dynamics exhibits dynamical localization and quantum recurrences.},

The longitudinal eigenmodes of zero frequency, which are important for the closure relation of photonic bands, is shown to contribute nothing to the propagating electric field.

We analyze the physical limitations of these conducting wires as well as how such miniaturized magnetic traps are affected by the nearby surface due to tunneling to the surface, surface thermal noise, electron scattering within the wire and the Casimir–Polder force. We show that wires with cross sections as small as a few tens of nanometers should enable robust operating conditions for coherent atom optics (e.g. tunneling barriers for interferometry). In particular, trap sizes of the order of the de Broglie wavelength become accessible, based solely on static magnetic fields, thereby bringing the atomchip a step closer to fulfilling its promise of a compact device for complex and accurate quantum optics with ultracold atoms.},

  abstract  = {Abstract The v2 Milestone 10 release of C++QED is primarily a feature release, which also corrects some problems of the previous release, especially as regards the build system. The adoption of C + + 11 features has led to many simplifications in the codebase. A full doxygen-based \{API\} manual [1] is now provided together with updated user guides. A largely automated, versatile new testsuite directed both towards computational and physics features allows for quickly spotting arising errors. The states of trajectories are now savable and recoverable with full binary precision, allowing for trajectory continuation regardless of evolution method (single/ensemble Monte Carlo wave-function or Master equation trajectory). As the main new feature, the framework now presents Python bindings to the highest-level programming interface, so that actual simulations for given composite quantum systems can now be performed from Python. New version program summary Program title: C + + \{QED\} Catalogue identifier: AELU_v2_0 Program summary URL:http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AELU_v2_0.html Program obtainable from: \{CPC\} Program Library, Queen’s University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: yes No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 492422 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 8070987 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: C + + /Python. Computer: i386-i686, x86 64. Operating system: In principle cross-platform, as yet tested only on UNIX-like systems (including Mac \{OS\} X). RAM: The framework itself takes about 60MB, which is fully shared. The additional memory taken by the program which defines the actual physical system (script) is typically less than 1MB. The memory storing the actual data scales with the system dimension for state-vector manipulations, and the square of the dimension for density-operator manipulations. This might easily be GBs, and often the memory of the machine limits the size of the simulated system. Classification: 4.3, 4.13, 6.2. External routines: Boost C + + libraries, \{GNU\} Scientific Library, Blitz + + , FLENS, NumPy, SciPy Catalogue identifier of previous version: AELU_v1_0 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 183 (2012) 1381 Does the new version supersede the previous version: Yes Nature of problem: Definition of (open) composite quantum systems out of elementary building blocks [2,3]. Manipulation of such systems, with emphasis on dynamical simulations such as Master-equation evolution [4] and Monte Carlo wave-function simulation [5]. Solution method: Master equation, Monte Carlo wave-function method Reasons for new version: The new version is mainly a feature release, but it does correct some problems of the previous version, especially as regards the build system. Summary of revisions: We give an example for a typical Python script implementing the ring-cavity system presented in Sec. 3.3 of Ref. [2]: Restrictions: Total dimensionality of the system. Master equation—few thousands. Monte Carlo wave-function trajectory—several millions. Unusual features: Because of the heavy use of compile-time algorithms, compilation of programs written in the framework may take a long time and much memory (up to several GBs). Additional comments: The framework is not a program, but provides and implements an application-programming interface for developing simulations in the indicated problem domain. We use several C + + 11 features which limits the range of supported compilers (g + + 4.7, clang + + 3.1) Documentation, http://cppqed.sourceforge.net/ Running time: Depending on the magnitude of the problem, can vary from a few seconds to weeks.

Of particular interest are laser-cooled atoms trapped in the evanescent field surrounding the optical nanofiber: they exhibit both long ground-state coherence times and efficient coupling to fiber-guided fields. Here, we demonstrate electromagnetically induced transparency, slow light, and the storage of fiber-guided optical pulses in an ensemble of cold atoms trapped in a nanofiber-based optical lattice. We measure group velocities of 50\&\#xA0;m/s. Moreover, we store optical pulses at the single-photon level and retrieve them on demand in the fiber after 2\&\#xA0;\&\#x3BC;s with an overall efficiency of (3.0\&\#xB1;0.4)\%. Our results show that nanofiber-based interfaces for cold atoms have great potential for the realization of building blocks for future optical quantum information networks.},

  abstract  = {The extinction spectra of spherical gold nanoparticles suspended in a homogeneous media were measured and the results were adjusted with Mie's theory together with an appropriate modification of the optical properties of bulk material considering the limitation that introduces the size of nanoparticles on the dielectric function. Usually, the contribution of free electrons to the dielectric function is modified for particle size, while the contribution of bound electrons is assumed to be independent of size. This work discusses the separated contribution of free and bound electrons on the optical properties of particles and their variation with size for gold nanoparticles. The effects of dielectric function and its changes with size on extinction spectra near plasmon resonance are considered. The damping constant for free electrons was changed with size as usual and a scattering constant of C = 0.8 was used. For the bound electron contribution, two different models were analysed to fit the extinction spectra: on the one hand, the damping constant for interband transitions and the gap energy were used as fitting parameters and on the other, the electronic density of states in the conduction band was made size-dependent. For the first model, extinction spectra corresponding to particles with radius R = 0.7 nm were fitted using two sets of values of the energy gap and damping constant: Eg = 2.3 eV and \\gamma_{\\mathrm {b}}=158\~{}\\mathrm {meV}/\\hbar or Eg = 2.1 eV and \\gamma_{\\mathrm {b}}=200\~{}\\mathrm {meV}/ \\hbar . For the second model, a simple assumption for the electronic density of states and its contribution to the dielectric function in terms of size allowed to adjust extinction spectra for all samples explored (from 0.3 to 1.6 nm radius). This last model uses only one parameter, a scale factor R0 = 0.35 nm, that controls the contribution of the bound electrons in nanoparticles. Contrast between the maximum and the minimum in the extinction spectra near the resonance at 520 nm or alternatively the broadening of the plasmon band can be used to determine the size of gold nanoparticles with radius smaller than 2 nm.},

  abstract  = {Quantum trajectory methods can be used for a wide range of open quantum systems to solve the master equation by unravelling the density operator evolution into individual stochastic trajectories in Hilbert space. This C++ class library offers a choice of integration algorithms for three important unravellings of the master equation. Different physical systems are modelled by different Hamiltonians and environment operators. The program achieves flexibility and user friendliness, without sacrificing execution speed, through the way it represents operators and states in Hilbert space. Primary operators, implemented in the form of simple routines acting on single degrees of freedom, can be used to build up arbitrarily complex operators in product Hilbert spaces with arbitrary numbers of components. Standard algebraic notation is used to build operators and to perform arithmetic operations on operators and states. States can be represented in a local moving basis, often leading to dramatic savings of computing resources. The state and operator classes are very general and can be used independently of the quantum trajectory algorithms. Only a rudimentary knowledge of C++ is required to use this package. The package illustrates how computational physics can profit from object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance.},

  abstract  = {We study the spontaneous emission of an excited atom close to an optical nanofiber and the resulting scattering forces. For a suitably chosen orientation of the atomic dipole, the spontaneous emission pattern becomes asymmetric and a resonant Casimir--Polder force parallel to the fiber axis arises. For a simple model case, we show that the such a lateral force is due to the interaction of the circularly oscillating atomic dipole moment with its image inside the material. With the Casimir--Polder energy being constant in the lateral direction, the predicted lateral force does not derive from a potential in the usual way. Our results have implications for optical force measurements on a substrate as well as for laser cooling of atoms in nanophotonic traps.},

In order to demonstrate quantum light-matter interaction, we establish coupling of quantum dots to our tunable NFBC and achieve an emission enhancement by a factor of 2.7.},

A group theoretical analysis of the symmetry properties of the propagating modes reveals a fundamental phenomenon: The degeneracy of the CW and CCW rotating modes is removed, giving rise to two distinct transmission bands. This effect induces symmetry-based dispersion which may limit the usable bandwidth of such structures. The properties of this band splitting and its impact on CROW performance for optical communications are studied in detail.},

The mode spectrum of individual spheres can be determined with high precision. A sphere with an appropriate spectrum can be selected, and a nanodiamond containing a single NV-centre can be coupled to it. The spectral position of the calculated lowest order whispering gallery modes are found to be in very good agreement with the experimentally observed resonances of the coupled fluorescence from the single NV-centre.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning algorithms learn a desired input-output relation from examples in order to interpret new inputs. This is important for tasks such as image and speech recognition or strategy optimisation, with growing applications in the IT industry. In the last couple of years, researchers investigated if quantum computing can help to improve classical machine learning algorithms. Ideas range from running computationally costly algorithms or their subroutines efficiently on a quantum computer to the translation of stochastic methods into the language of quantum theory. This contribution gives a systematic overview of the emerging field of quantum machine learning. It presents the approaches as well as technical details in an accessible way, and discusses the potential of a future theory of quantum learning.},

A maximal mf=±1 Raman coherence is prepared in an ensemble of 8.5×105 laser-cooled Rb87 atoms in the f=1 hyperfine ground state, and the collective spin is squeezed by synthesized optical quantum nondemolition measurement. This prepares a state with large spin alignment and noise below the projection-noise level in a mixed alignment-orientation variable. 3.2 dB of noise reduction is observed and 2.0 dB of squeezing by the Wineland criterion, implying both entanglement and metrological advantage. Enhanced sensitivity is demonstrated in field measurements using alignment-to-orientation conversion.},

The parties in quantum communication can in principle obtain a maximally entangled state from each N-photon system with a success probability of 100%. That is, it does not consume the less-entangled photon systems largely, which is far different from other multipartite entanglement purification schemes. This feature maybe make this scheme more feasible in practical applications.},

We realized a single-photon–activated switch capable of routing a photon from any of its two inputs to any of its two outputs. Our device is based on a single atom coupled to a fiber-coupled, chip-based microresonator. A single reflected control photon toggles the switch from high reflection (R ~ 65%) to high transmission (T ~ 90%), with an average of ~1.5 control photons per switching event (~3, including linear losses). No additional control fields are required. The control and target photons are both in-fiber and practically identical, making this scheme compatible with scalable architectures for quantum information processing.},

An updated overview of their optical properties, including spontaneous emission, ultrafast carrier dynamics, cavity resonance feedback (lasing), photodetection, and waveguiding, is provided. The ability to physically manipulate these structures on surfaces to form simple networks and assemblies is the first step toward integrating chemically synthesized nanomaterials into photonic circuitry. These high index semiconductor nanowires are capable of efficiently guiding light through liquid media, suggesting a role for such materials in microfluidics-based biosensing applications.},

First we show experimentally the concept of the transport of micron-sized spheres along a tapered fiber and measure the particle velocity. Having demonstrated the principle we then consider theoretically the application to the optical trapping and guiding of metallic nanoparticles, where the presence of a plasmon resonance is used to enhance optical forces. We show that the dynamics of the nanoparticles trapped by the evanescent field can be controlled by the state of polarization of the fiber mode, and by using more than one wavelength differently detuned from the nanoparticle plasmon resonance. Such a scheme could potentially be used for selectively trapping and transporting nano- or microscopic material from a polydisperse suspension.},

This thesis presents experimental investigations into quantum control and measurement using laser cooled cesium atoms. On the control side, we present an experimental realization of a protocol to achieve full controllability of the entire hyperfine ground manifold of cesium. In particular, we demonstrate the ability to map between arbitrary states with fidelity greater than 0.99, using a combination of static, radio frequency, and microwave magnetic fields. On the measurement side, we present an experimental realization of quantum state tomography. The tomography protocol begins by measuring expectation values of an informationally complete set of observables using a weak optical probe in combination with dynamical control. The measurement record is processed using two different state estimation algorithms, allowing us to estimate a quantum state with fidelity greater than 0.9.},

Removing the nonlinearity allows a nonperturbing measurement on the much longer time scale set by decoherence.

We investigate enhanced spontaneous emission and the photonic Lamb shift for emitters whose resonant frequencies are near the waveguide frequency cutoff where the waveguide behaves as an ɛ-near-zero metamaterial. Via a dyadic Green's function-based field quantization scheme, we calculate the photonic Lamb shift as well as the spontaneous emission enhancement and spectrum. Using realistic parameters for typical quantum emitters, we suggest experimentally realizable schemes to observe relatively large photonic Lamb shifts in waveguides.},

An off-resonance linearly polarized probe beam that propagates through the ONF experiences a slow axis of polarization produced by trapped atoms on opposite sides along the ONF. The transverse atomic motion is imprinted onto the probe polarization through the changing atomic index of refraction. By applying a transient impulse, we measure a time-dependent polarization rotation of the probe beam that provides both a rapid and non-destructive measurement of the optical trapping frequencies.},

We demonstrate transport of 108Cs atoms approximately 20 cm with minimal heating. We show that it is possible for one to control the direction and speed of the atoms in the tunnel by varying the detuning of the tunnel beam.},

  abstract  = {Neutral atom systems are an appealing platform for the development and testing of quantum control and measurement techniques. This dissertation presents experimental investigations of control and measurement tools using as a testbed the 16-dimensional hyperfine manifold associated with the electronic ground state of cesium atoms. On the control side, we present an experimental realization of a protocol to implement robust unitary transformations in the presence of static and dynamic perturbations. We also present an experimental realization of inhomogeneous quantum control. Specifically, we demonstrate our ability to perform two different unitary transformations on atoms that see different light shifts from an optical addressing field. On the measurement side, we present experimental realizations of quantum state and process tomography. The state tomography project encompasses a comprehensive evaluation of several measurement strategies and state estimation algorithms. Our experimental results show that in the presence of experimental imperfections, there is a clear tradeoff between accuracy, efficiency and robustness in the reconstruction. The process tomography project involves an experimental demonstration of efficient reconstruction by using a set of intelligent probe states. Experimental results show that we are able to reconstruct unitary maps in Hilbert spaces with dimension ranging from d=4 to d=16. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a unitary process in d=16 is successfully reconstructed in the laboratory.},

With this purpose-built cold atomic ensemble we implemented the gradient echo memory (GEM) scheme on the D1 line. Our data shows a memory efficiency of 80 ± 2% and coherence times up to 195 μ s.},

  abstract  = {We report the observation of low-light level optical interactions in a tapered optical nanofiber (TNF) embedded in a hot rubidium vapor. The small optical mode area plays a significant role in the optical properties of the hot vapor Rb-TNF system, allowing nonlinear optical interactions with nW level powers even in the presence of transit-time dephasing rates much larger than the intrinsic linewidth. We demonstrate nonlinear absorption and V-type electromagnetically induced transparency with cw powers below 10 nW, comparable to the best results in any Rb-optical waveguide system. The good performance and flexibility of the Rb-TNF system makes it a very promising candidate for ultralow power resonant nonlinear optical applications.},

  abstract  = {The subject of quantum computing brings together ideas from classical information theory, computer science, and quantum physics. This review aims to summarize not just quantum computing, but the whole subject of quantum information theory. Information can be identified as the most general thing which must propagate from a cause to an effect. It therefore has a fundamentally important role in the science of physics. However, the mathematical treatment of information, especially information processing, is quite recent, dating from the mid-20th century. This has meant that the full significance of information as a basic concept in physics is only now being discovered. This is especially true in quantum mechanics. The theory of quantum information and computing puts this significance on a firm footing, and has led to some profound and exciting new insights into the natural world. Among these are the use of quantum states to permit the secure transmission of classical information (quantum cryptography), the use of quantum entanglement to permit reliable transmission of quantum states (teleportation), the possibility of preserving quantum coherence in the presence of irreversible noise processes (quantum error correction), and the use of controlled quantum evolution for efficient computation (quantum computation). The common theme of all these insights is the use of quantum entanglement as a computational resource. It turns out that information theory and quantum mechanics fit together very well. In order to explain their relationship, this review begins with an introduction to classical information theory and computer science, including Shannon's theorem, error correcting codes, Turing machines and computational complexity. The principles of quantum mechanics are then outlined, and the Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) experiment described. The EPR-Bell correlations, and quantum entanglement in general, form the essential new ingredient which distinguishes quantum from classical information theory and, arguably, quantum from classical physics. Basic quantum information ideas are next outlined, including qubits and data compression, quantum gates, the `no cloning' property and teleportation. Quantum cryptography is briefly sketched. The universal quantum computer (QC) is described, based on the Church-Turing principle and a network model of computation. Algorithms for such a computer are discussed, especially those for finding the period of a function, and searching a random list. Such algorithms prove that a QC of sufficiently precise construction is not only fundamentally different from any computer which can only manipulate classical information, but can compute a small class of functions with greater efficiency. This implies that some important computational tasks are impossible for any device apart from a QC. To build a universal QC is well beyond the abilities of current technology. However, the principles of quantum information physics can be tested on smaller devices. The current experimental situation is reviewed, with emphasis on the linear ion trap, high- Q optical cavities, and nuclear magnetic resonance methods. These allow coherent control in a Hilbert space of eight dimensions (three qubits) and should be extendable up to a thousand or more dimensions (10 qubits). Among other things, these systems will allow the feasibility of quantum computing to be assessed. In fact such experiments are so difficult that it seemed likely until recently that a practically useful QC (requiring, say, 1000 qubits) was actually ruled out by considerations of experimental imprecision and the unavoidable coupling between any system and its environment. However, a further fundamental part of quantum information physics provides a solution to this impasse. This is quantum error correction (QEC). An introduction to QEC is provided. The evolution of the QC is restricted to a carefully chosen subspace of its Hilbert space. Errors are almost certain to cause a departure from this subspace. QEC provides a means to detect and undo such departures without upsetting the quantum computation. This achieves the apparently impossible, since the computation preserves quantum coherence even though during its course all the qubits in the computer will have relaxed spontaneously many times. The review concludes with an outline of the main features of quantum information physics and avenues for future research.},

Based on these results, we have designed a nanofiber-waist TOF with broadband transmission for surface spectroscopy of organic molecules. Moreover, our method allows us to analyze the loss mechanisms of optical nanofibers.},

The asymmetric structure of integrated waveguides leads to a large birefringence that is not encountered in cylindrically symmetric optical nanofibers. We have studied both theoretically and experimentally the modal properties and suitability of silicon nitride rib waveguides for cold-atom trapping. The dependence of the modal effective index on the rib width is explored experimentally by measuring beat lengths between propagating modes. These measurements are made using a novel spatial Fourier analysis technique based on conventional far-field imaging of elastic scattering from the waveguide. We find that the beat length between the lowest order TE00 and TM00 modes is approximately 5\&\#x000B5;m, in excellent agreement with numerical calculations. We propose to take advantage of this birefringence and mode structure to create novel, one-dimensional periodic trapping potentials for atoms within the evanescent field of the waveguide.},

Fortunately, it is still possible to investigate a many-particle entanglement when the state of the system possesses sufficient symmetry. In this paper, we present a practical method for efficiently computing various bipartite entanglement measures for states in the symmetric subspace and perform these calculations for N~103. By considering all possible bipartite splits, we construct a picture of the multiscale entanglement in large symmetric systems. In particular, we characterize dynamically generated spin-squeezed states by comparing them to known reference states (e.g., Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and Dicke states), and families of states with near-maximal bipartite entropy. We quantify the trade-off between the degree of entanglement and its robustness to particle loss, emphasizing that substantial entanglement need not be fragile.},

  abstract  = {We assess routes to a diamond-based quantum computer, where we specifically look towards scalable devices, with at least 10 linked quantum gates. Such a computer should satisfy the deVincenzo rules and might be used at convenient temperatures. The specific examples that we examine are based on the optical control of electron spins. For some such devices, nuclear spins give additional advantages. Since there have already been demonstrations of basic initialization and readout, our emphasis is on routes to two-qubit quantum gate operations and the linking of perhaps 10 0 such gates. We analyse the dopant properties necessary, especially centres containing N and P, and give results using simple scoping calculations for the key interactions determining gate performance. Our conclusions are cautiously optimistic: it may be possible to develop a useful quantum information processor that works above cryogenic temperatures.},

  abstract  = {We present a surface integral equation (SIE) to model the electromagnetic behavior of metallic objects at optical frequencies. The electric and magnetic current combined field integral equation considering both tangential and normal equations is applied. The SIE is solved by using a method-of-moments (MoM) formulation. The SIE-MoM approach is applied only on the material boundary surfaces and interfaces, avoiding the cumbersome volumetric discretization of the objects and the surrounding space required in differential-equation formulations. Some canonical examples have been analyzed, and the results have been compared with analytical reference solutions in order to prove the accuracy of the proposed method. Finally, two plasmonic Yagi--Uda nanoantennas have been analyzed, illustrating the applicability of the method to the solution of real plasmonic problems.},

Since Yb171 atoms have only a nuclear spin of one-half in the ground state, the system constitutes the simplest spin ensemble and is thus robust against decoherence. We used very short pulses with a width of 100 ns, and as a result the interaction time became much shorter than the decoherence time, which is important for multistep quantum information processing.},

This is crucial for the success of many recently proposed quantum information applications of the NV defects. We further find that an external electric field can be used to completely control the optical properties of a single centre. Finally, a group theoretical model is developed that explains the observations and provides good physical understanding of the excited state structure.},

Here, surface plasmons—electromagnetic excitations coupled to electron charge density waves on metal–dielectric interfaces or localized on metallic nanostructures—enable the confinement of light to scales far below that of conventional optics. We review recent progress in the experimental and theoretical investigation of the quantum properties of surface plasmons, their role in controlling light–matter interactions at the quantum level and potential applications. Quantum plasmonics opens up a new frontier in the study of the fundamental physics of surface plasmons and the realization of quantum-controlled devices, including single-photon sources, transistors and ultra-compact circuitry at the nanoscale.},

The surface assumed is perpendicular to the axis of circular cylinders (steel) embedded periodically in a background material (polymer).

  abstract   = {Many effects in the interaction between atoms and a cavity that are usually described in quantum mechanical terms (cavity quantum electrodynamics, cavity QED) can be understood and quantitatively analyzed within a classical framework. We adopt such a classical picture of a radiating dipole oscillator to derive explicit expressions for the coupling of single atoms and atomic ensembles to Gaussian modes in free space and in an optical resonator. The cooperativity parameter of cavity QED is shown to play a central role and is given a geometrical interpretation. The classical analysis yields transparent, intuitive results that are useful for analyzing applications of cavity QED such as atom detection and counting, cavity cooling, cavity spin squeezing, cavity spin optomechanics, or phase transitions associated with the self-organization of the ensemble-light system.},

If the phase of the controlling field is set oppositely to that of the signal field, the combination of SGC with weak pump overcomes the drawback of incompletely retrieval in the conventional scheme, leading to 100% retrieval fidelity or even to the amplification of the retrieved signal with respect to its initial one.},

  abstract  = {The authors calculate scattered, transmitted and reflected spectra for a coupled two-level atom and quantized electromagnetic cavity mode driven by broad-band chaotic light. They obtain analytical results in the secular approximation and compare these with exact numerical results. Under cavity QED conditions (strong dipole coupling) the spectra show multiple resonances at the incommensurate transition frequencies of the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian. They obtain expressions for linewidths and transition amplitudes that help them to assess the prospects for an experimental observation of these Jaynes-Cummings resonances.},

Our approach makes use of single-sided conical tapered optical fibers that are evanescently coupled over the last \&\#x223C;10\&\#x2009;\&\#x2009;\&\#x3BC;m to a nanophotonic waveguide. By means of adiabatic mode transfer using a properly chosen taper, single-mode fiber-waveguide coupling efficiencies as high as 97(1)\% are achieved. Efficient coupling is obtained for a wide range of device geometries, which are either singly clamped on a chip or attached to the fiber, demonstrating a promising approach for integrated nanophotonic circuits, and quantum optical and nanoscale sensing applications.},

The refractive index changes needed for ultrahigh-Q cavities with Q ~ 107, are well within what can be achieved ($\Delta$n ~ 0.02). The cavity modes have relatively small volumes V\2 ($\lambda$/n)3, making them ideal for cavity quantum electro-dynamic applications. Importantly for realistic fabrication, our design is flexible because the range of parameters, cavity length and the index changes, that enables an ultrahigh-Q is quite broad. Furthermore as the index modification is post-processed, an efficient technique to generate cavities around defect centres is achievable, improving prospects for defect-tolerant quantum architectures.},

  abstract  = {The dispersive properties of materials, i.e., their frequency-dependent response to the interaction with light, in most situations determines whether an optical process can be observed. Although one can always search for a specific material with the sought-after properties, this material might be far from optimum or might not even exist. Therefore, it is of great interest to develop methods that could tune the dispersive properties of a medium independently of the working frequency band. Pulses with angular dispersion, or pulse-front tilt, precisely allow us to achieve this goal. In this tutorial, we show the basics of how angular dispersion can manage to tune the dispersion parameters that characterize the propagation of light in a medium, thus permitting the observation and application of various optical processes in nonlinear and quantum optics that could not be realized otherwise. To keep the focus on first principles, the list of topics addressed is not exhaustive. More specifically, we consider the role of angular dispersion for pulse stretching and compression, broadband second-harmonic generation, the generation of temporal solitons in nonlinear $\chi$(2) media, the tunable generation of terahertz waves by means of optical rectification of femtosecond pulses, and the tuning of the frequency correlations and of the bandwidth of entangled paired photons.},

  abstract  = {We describe a new approach to spin squeezing based on a double-pass Faraday interaction between an optical probe and an optically dense atomic sample. A quantum eraser is used to remove residual spin-probe entanglement, thereby realizing a single-axis twisting unitary map on the collective spin. This interaction can be phase matched, resulting in exponential enhancement of squeezing as a function of optical density for times short compared to the decoherence time. In practice the scaling and peak squeezing depends on decoherence, technical loss, and noise. Including these imperfections, our model indicates that ~10 dB of squeezing should be achievable with laboratory parameters.},

Twisted fibers may be used as polarization rotators. A fiber with a {\textpm}68{\textdegree} double twist operates as a fast/slow mode interchanger, suitable for delay equalization.},

A volume integral equation technique, based on Green's function theory for fiber boundaries, is used to formulate the problem. For the case of spherical scatterers, an analytical solution is developed by using an expansion in spherical vector wave functions, when b(1-2) \ 1, where (1-2) is the difference between the wave numbers of the fiber and the spherical scatterer whose radius is b. Expressions are obtained for the reflection, transmission, and radiated-field quantities up to the order of \[b(1-2)\]5. Numerical results are computed and presented for several cases. Coupling between even---odd HE11 modes is treated also.},

In order to further increase the performance and fidelities achieved in these protocols, a deeper understanding of the relevant noise and decoherence processes needs to be gained. In this paper, we provide for the first time a complete description of the decoherence from spontaneous emission. We derive from first principles the effects of photons being spontaneously emitted into unobserved modes. Our results relate the resulting decay and noise terms in effective equations of motion for collective atomic spins and the forward-propagating light modes to the full atomic level structure. We illustrate and apply our results to the case of a quantum memory protocol. Our results can be applied to any alkali atoms, and the general approach taken in this paper can be applied to light–matter interfaces and quantum memories based on different mechanisms.},

  abstract      = {The unique capability of quantum mechanics to evolve alternative possibilities in parallel is appealing and over the years a number of quantum algorithms have been developed offering great computational benefits. Systems coupled to the environment lose quantum coherence quickly and realization of schemes based on unitarity might be impossible. Recent discovery of room temperature quantum coherence in light harvesting complexes opens up new possibilities to borrow concepts from biology to use quantum effects for computational purposes. While it has been conjectured that light harvesting complexes such as the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex in the green sulfur bacteria performs an efficient quantum search similar to the quantum Grover's algorithm the analogy has yet to be established. In this work we show that quantum dissipation plays an essential role in the quantum search performed in the FMO complex and it is fundamentally different from known algorithms. In the FMO complex not just the optimal level of phase breaking is present to avoid both quantum localization and Zeno trapping but it can harness quantum dissipation as well to speed the process even further up. With detailed quantum calculations taking into account both phase breaking and quantum dissipation we show that the design of the FMO complex has been evolutionarily optimized and works faster than pure quantum or classical-stochastic algorithms. Inspired by the findings we introduce a new computational concept based on decoherent quantum evolution. While it is inspired by light harvesting systems, the new computational devices can also be realized on different material basis opening new magnitude scales for miniaturization and speed.},

Here we simultaneously realize both of these tasks with cesium atoms interacting with a multicolor evanescent field surrounding an optical nanofiber. The atoms are localized in a one-dimensional optical lattice about 200 nm above the nanofiber surface and can be efficiently interrogated with a resonant light field sent through the nanofiber. Our technique opens the route towards the direct integration of laser-cooled atomic ensembles within fiber networks, an important prerequisite for large scale quantum communication schemes. Moreover, it is ideally suited to the realization of hybrid quantum systems that combine atoms with, e.g., solid state quantum devices.},

  abstract  = {A novel method of generation and synthesis of azimuthally E-polarized vortex beams is presented. Along the beam axis such beams have a strong longitudinally polarized magnetic field where ideally there is no electric field. We show how these beams can be constructed through the interference of Laguerre\&\#x2013;Gaussian beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM), and then quantify the longitudinal magnetic field of such beams. As an example, we present a metasurface made of double-split ring slot pairs and report a good agreement between simulated and analytical results. Both a high magnetic-to-electric-field contrast ratio and a magnetic field enhancement are achieved. We also investigate the metasurface physical constraints to convert a linearly polarized beam into an azimuthally E-polarized beam and characterize the performance of magnetic field enhancement and electric field suppression of a realistic metasurface. These findings are potentially useful for novel optical spectroscopy related to magnetic dipolar transitions and for optical manipulation of particles with spin and OAM.},

  abstract  = {C++QED is a versatile framework for simulating open quantum dynamics. It allows to build arbitrarily complex quantum systems from elementary free subsystems and interactions, and simulate their time evolution with the available time-evolution drivers. Through this framework, we introduce a design which should be generic for high-level representations of composite quantum systems. It relies heavily on the object-oriented and generic programming paradigms on one hand, and on the other hand, compile-time algorithms, in particular C++ template-metaprogramming techniques. The core of the design is the data structure which represents the state vectors of composite quantum systems. This data structure models the multi-array concept. The use of template metaprogramming is not only crucial to the design, but with its use all computations pertaining to the layout of the simulated system can be shifted to compile time, hence cutting on runtime.

No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 597 4 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 4 74 39 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: C++ Computer: i386–i686, x86_64 Operating system: In principle cross-platform, as yet tested only on UNIX-like systems (including Mac \{OS\} X). RAM: The framework itself takes about 60 MB, which is fully shared. The additional memory taken by the program which defines the actual physical system (script) is typically less than 1 MB. The memory storing the actual data scales with the system dimension for state-vector manipulations, and the square of the dimension for density-operator manipulations. This might easily be GBs, and often the memory of the machine limits the size of the simulated system. Classification: 4.3, 4.13, 6.2, 20 External routines: Boost C++ libraries (http://www.boost.org/), \{GNU\} Scientific Library (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/), Blitz++ (http://www.oonumerics.org/blitz/), Linear Algebra Package Flexible Library for Efficient Numerical Solutions (http://flens.sourceforge.net/). Nature of problem: Definition of (open) composite quantum systems out of elementary building blocks [1]. Manipulation of such systems, with emphasis on dynamical simulations such as Master-equation evolution [2] and Monte Carlo wave-function simulation [3]. Solution method: Master equation, Monte Carlo wave-function method. Restrictions: Total dimensionality of the system. Master equation few thousands. Monte Carlo wave-function trajectory several millions. Unusual features: Because of the heavy use of compile-time algorithms, compilation of programs written in the framework may take a long time and much memory (up to several GBs). Additional comments: The framework is not a program, but provides and implements an application-programming interface for developing simulations in the indicated problem domain. Supplementary information: http://cppqed.sourceforge.net/. Running time: Depending on the magnitude of the problem, can vary from a few seconds to weeks. References:[1] A. Vukics, H.

  abstract  = {The interaction of matter and light is one of the fundamental processes occurring in nature, and its most elementary form is realized when a single atom interacts with a single photon. Reaching this regime has been a major focus of research in atomic physics and quantum optics for several decades and has generated the field of cavity quantum electrodynamics. Here we perform an experiment in which a superconducting two-level system, playing the role of an artificial atom, is coupled to an on-chip cavity consisting of a superconducting transmission line resonator. We show that the strong coupling regime can be attained in a solid-state system, and we experimentally observe the coherent interaction of a superconducting two-level system with a single microwave photon. The concept of circuit quantum electrodynamics opens many new possibilities for studying the strong interaction of light and matter. This system can also be exploited for quantum information processing and quantum communication and may lead to new approaches for single photon generation and detection.},

  abstract  = {The microstructure and electronic structure of silicon-rich oxide (SRO) films were investigated using transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy as the main analytical techniques. The as-deposited SRO film was found to be a single phase SiO1.0, as suggested by its electronic structure characteristics determined by the valence electron energy loss spectrum. This single phase undergoes a continuous but incomplete phase decomposition to Si and SiO2 for films annealed between 300 and 1100°C. The resulting Si phase first appears as  nm-diameter amorphous clusters which grow to larger sizes at higher annealing temperatures, but only crystallize at a critical temperature between 800 and 900°C. This cluster/matrix configuration of the SRO films is consistent with the appearance of the interface plasmon and its oscillator strength as a function of the nanoparticle size. Three separate stages were identified in the sequence of annealed films that were characterized by the presence of single-phase SiO, amorphous silicon nanoclusters, and silicon nanocrystals, respectively. The presence of amorphous silicon nanoclusters in the intermediate stage, the mean size of which can be controlled via annealing, may offer an alternative to silicon nanocrystal composites for optical applications.},

If the squeezing parameter is less than or equal to 1, we demonstrate a quantitative relation between the squeezing parameter and the concurrence for the even and odd states. We prove that the even states generated from the initial state with all qubits being spin down, via the one-axis twisting Hamiltonian, are spin squeezed if and only if they are pairwise entangled. For the states generated via the one-axis twisting Hamiltonian with an external transverse field for any number of qubits greater than 1 or via the two-axis countertwisting Hamiltonian for any even number of qubits, the numerical results suggest that such states are spin squeezed if and only if they are pairwise entangled.},

Different from the closed system, we show that the bistable threshold intensity and related hysteresis loop can be controlled by adjusting the ratio between atomic injection and exit rates. More interestingly, the appearance and disappearance of OB can be transformed mutually by varying the relative phase of three coherent fields under the condition of a strong spontaneously generated coherence. The manipulation of OB behavior through the intensity of the microwave field and the atomic cooperation parameter is also analyzed.},

It is of particular relevance to the emission of gravitational waves from oscillating neutron stars, which are expected to possess significant differential rotation immediately after birth or binary merger. In a previous paper we analysed the normal modes of a simple system exhibiting differential rotation. In this complementary paper we address the initial-value problem for the same simple model using both analytical methods and numerical time-evolutions. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for dynamical shear instability. We discuss the dynamical behaviour of the continuous spectrum in response to an initial perturbation, and show that certain singular solutions within the continuous spectrum appear physically indistinguishable from the discrete modes outside the continuous spectrum.},

  abstract  = {The strong interaction between individual Rydberg atoms provides a powerful tool exploited in an ever-growing range of applications in quantum information science, quantum simulation and ultracold chemistry. One hallmark of the Rydberg interaction is that both its strength and angular dependence can be fine-tuned with great flexibility by choosing appropriate Rydberg states and applying external electric and magnetic fields. More and more experiments are probing this interaction at short atomic distances or with such high precision that perturbative calculations as well as restrictions to the leading dipole–dipole interaction term are no longer sufficient. In this tutorial, we review all relevant aspects of the full calculation of Rydberg interaction potentials. We discuss the derivation of the interaction Hamiltonian from the electrostatic multipole expansion, numerical and analytical methods for calculating the required electric multipole moments and the inclusion of electromagnetic fields with arbitrary direction. We focus specifically on symmetry arguments and selection rules, which greatly reduce the size of the Hamiltonian matrix, enabling the direct diagonalization of the Hamiltonian up to higher multipole orders on a desktop computer. Finally, we present example calculations showing the relevance of the full interaction calculation to current experiments. Our software for calculating Rydberg potentials including all features discussed in this tutorial is available as open source.},

When choosing a gauge in which the static potential vanishes, the normal modes of the medium with disorder satisfy a different transversality condition than the modes of the ideal medium. Our first result is an integral equation for optical modes such that all perturbation-theory solutions by construction satisfy the desired transversality condition. Secondly, when expanding the vector potential for the medium with disorder in terms of the normal modes of the ideal structure, we find the gauge transformation that conveniently makes the static potential zero, thereby generalizing work by Glauber and Lewenstein (1991) [15]. Our results are relevant for the quantum optics of disordered photonic crystals.},

Owing to the very low taper losses, the finesse of the resonator reaches F$=$86 while the on-resonance transmission is T$=$11\%. The characteristics of our resonator fulfill the requirements of nonlinear optics and cavity quantum electrodynamics in the strong coupling regime. These characteristics, combined with the demonstrated ease of use and advantageous mode geometry, open a realm of applications.},

The cavity is formed by combining an optical nanofiber and a nanofabricated grating to create a composite photonic crystal cavity. By using this technique, significant enhancement of the spontaneous emission rate into the nanofiber guided modes is observed for single quantum dots. Our results pave the way for enhanced on-fiber light-matter interfaces with clear applications to quantum networks.},

  abstract  = {Optically active helical microparticles are studied in the forms of thin films, suspensions and powders. From fabricated helical porous thin films, microparticle suspensions are obtained by removing the microparticles (film columns) from their substrates and dispersing them into water. For removing microparticles, four methods are explored and compared: sacrificial {NaCl} layer, gold (Au) layer, buffered oxide etching, and direct ultrasonic agitation. The primary film material studied in this work is amorphous silicon (Si). Physical morphology of the microparticles is examined with scanning electron microscopy ({SEM}). Methods employed to characterize optical activity of the microparticles include: polarimetry, spectrophotometry, and spectroscopic ellipsometry ({SE}). The produced chiral microparticles exhibit optical activity: optical rotation ({OR}) and circular dichroism ({CD} - in the form of differential circular transmission ({DCT})). Significant findings include: (a) we observe the largest optical rotatory power ever reported in scientific literature, 11◦μm at 610 nm wavelength for a Si film; (b) for the helical thin films, there is one dominant {DCT} band in the measured wavelength range; however for microparticle suspensions and powders, there exist two {DCT} bands: one broad band at long wavelengths, and one narrow band in the short wavelength range; compared to their thin film forms, microparticle suspensions and powders have inverted sign for the broad {DCT} band. A discrete dipole approximation ({DDA}) model is employed to calculate optical response (e.g. extinction, scattering, and absorption cross-sections) of the microparticles, so as to enable us to understand the effects of different structural parameters of the microparticles on their optical response. Calculation confirms that optical activity of chiral microparticles is due to coherent light scatterings with the chiral structures of the particles. The inversion in sign of the broad {DCT} bands of microparticle suspensions and powders is likely due to the averaging effect from random orientation of the helical microparticles, as is indicated both from experimental results and from calculation.},

One scheme makes use of Raman transition with the cavity field virtually excited, and the other enables Bell state preparation and quantum information transfer by virtue of dark state evolution and adiabatic passage, which is tolerant to ambient noise and experimental parameter fluctuations. We justify our schemes by considering their experimental feasibility and challenge, using the currently available technology.},

The limitations, challenges, and exciting prospects of developing on-chip quantum light sources using integrated photonic crystal structures are discussed.},

  abstract  = {We propose a new type of optical waveguide that consists of a sequence of coupled high-Q resonators. Unlike other types of optical waveguide, waveguiding in the coupled-resonator optical waveguide (CROW) is achieved through weak coupling between otherwise localized high-Q optical cavities. Employing a formalism similar to the tight-binding method in solid-state physics, we obtain the relations for the dispersion and the group velocity of the photonic band of the CROW's and find that they are solely characterized by coupling factor k1 . We also demonstrate the possibility of highly efficient nonlinear optical frequency conversion and perfect transmission through bends in CROW's.},

  abstract  = {We consider N four level atoms coupled to an orthogonally polarized, degenerate two-mode optical cavity. Starting with the atoms prepared in one of the degenerate ground states a single photon introduced into the driven cavity mode will be recycled to pump multiple atoms to the other ground state. For two atoms we analytically calculate the steady state using quantum trajectory equations and show that the system makes stochastic transitions between two different subspaces with the transition correlated with the emission of a polarized photon from one of the two modes of the cavity. In this way the long time evolution of the atomic state can be monitored by direct photodetection of the cavity decay passed through a polarizing beam splitter. We also investigate the dynamics of the approach to the steady state by numerical simulations carried out using the Quantum Toolbox in Python (QuTiP).},

Since the radiation pressure transferred laterally from the evanescent wave is negated on both sides, particles can be stably aligned. By projecting a circular and a linear beam spot onto the interface, both multiple and single arrays of particles are achieved. Arrays of particles trapped on the interface can be easily moved adjusting the intensity of incident beams on either side. We also simulate electromagnetic distribution of scattering light that is converted from the evanescent wave using the FDTD method. The results show that scattering light converts from an evanescent wave propagating through a particle array and has a distance longer than that propagating from a normal evanescent wave.},

The measurement detects the atom-induced shift of the resonance frequency of an optical cavity containing the ensemble. While spatially varying coupling of atoms to the cavity prevents the direct observation of a quantized signal, the demonstrated measurement resolution provides the readout capability necessary for atomic interferometry substantially below the standard quantum limit and down to the Heisenberg limit.},

  abstract      = {A quantum simulator is a restricted class of quantum computer that controls the interactions between quantum bits in a way that can be mapped to certain difficult quantum many-body problems. As more control is exerted over larger numbers of qubits, the simulator can tackle a wider range of problems, with the ultimate limit being a universal quantum computer that can solve general classes of hard problems. We use a quantum simulator composed of up to 53 qubits to study a non-equilibrium phase transition in the transverse field Ising model of magnetism, in a regime where conventional statistical mechanics does not apply. The qubits are represented by trapped ion spins that can be prepared in a variety of initial pure states. We apply a global long-range Ising interaction with controllable strength and range, and measure each individual qubit with near 99\% efficiency. This allows the single-shot measurement of arbitrary many-body correlations for the direct probing of the dynamical phase transition and the uncovering of computationally intractable features that rely on the long-range interactions and high connectivity between the qubits.},

  abstract  = {A tapered optical nanofiber is simultaneously used to trap and optically interface cold atoms through evanescent fields and constitutes a new and well controllable hybrid quantum system. The atoms are trapped in two parallel one dimensional (1D) optical lattices generated by suitable far blue and red detuned evanescent field modes very close to opposite sides of the nanofiber surface. Collective electronic excitations (excitons) of each of the optical lattices are resonantly coupled to the second lattice forming symmetric and antisymmetric common excitons. In contrast to the inverse cube dependence of the individual atomic dipole–dipole interaction, we analytically find an exponentially decaying coupling strength with distance between the lattices. The resulting symmetric (bright) excitons strongly interact with the resonant nanofiber photons to form fiber polaritons, which can be observed through linear optical spectra. For large enough wave vectors, the polariton decay rate to free space is strongly reduced, which should render this system ideal for the realization of long-range quantum communication between atomic ensembles.},

  abstract  = {The evanescent field surrounding nanoscale optical waveguides offers an efficient interface between light and mesoscopic ensembles of neutral atoms. However, the thermal motion of trapped atoms, combined with the strong radial gradients of the guided light, leads to a time-modulated coupling between atoms and the light mode, thus giving rise to additional noise and motional dephasing of collective states. Here, we present a dipole force free scheme for coupling of the radial motional states, utilizing the strong intensity gradient of the guided mode and demonstrate all-optical coupling of the cesium hyperfine ground states and motional sideband transitions. We utilize this to prolong the trap lifetime of an atomic ensemble by Raman sideband cooling of the radial motion which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been demonstrated in nano-optical structures previously. This Letter points towards full and independent control of internal and external atomic degrees of freedom using guided light modes only.},
