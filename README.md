# Dispersive quantum interface with atoms and nanophotonic waveguides

***Work in progress***. [Comments](https://github.com/i2000s/PhD_Thesis/issues) and editorial inputs are highly welcome!

Some data of plots are compiled into TikZ files.
Some data and scripts can be found in our previous paper repositories, for example, including [the repo for our Faraday spin squeezing protocol paper](https://github.com/CQuIC/FaradaySqueezingProtocol) (CC By 4.0),
and [the repo for the simulations of Green's tensors and spontaneous emission rates with waveguides](https://github.com/i2000s/simnanophotonics) (Jupyter notebooks with Julia v0.6 as the scripting language, MIT license).
